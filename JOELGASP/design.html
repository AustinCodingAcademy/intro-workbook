          <h1>WAHINE ON WHEELS</h1><br>
          <p>"I met Joel a few years ago, while working on a project called Wahine on Wheels.
          WOW was originally a skate club for the University, but with Joel’s guidance it
          became much more. For the first time I can remember, I was able to execute visions
          I had in my head for designs and logos and what would have been an everyday flyer
          became art. This collaborative effort was especially helped by Joel’s patience and
          engagement in the project. I would highly recommend Joel for any project that
          needs up-to-date trends, unique graphics, or creative nurturing; his best attribute
          is his ability to communicate and work with a variety of different business owners
          and artists looking to make their ideas come to life."</p><br><br>
