        <div class="text-about">
          <p>Born in Tijuana, Baja California Norte, on 1968, from an early age he discovered his skills in drawing and painting, he liked to go outside the city to climb the hills and spend long periods appreciating and memorizing every detail of landscape and then put them into drawings or paintings.
          It was in high school when he demonstrated his skills in painting.  He  participated and won first place at the local and national level, which won him a scholarship in the workshop at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California to study painting with Master Francisco Chavez Corrujedo and where he was part of several group exhibitions.

          He earned a degree in Engineer ing Computer Science with honors from  the ITESM, Campus Monterrey in 1992. He pursued his career for over 20 years, but his passion for art and landscaping has led him perfecting different techniques using oil and acrylic, producing many works during this time.

          His interest and passion for the study of the life of plants of different species and of trees has led him to participate in the art of growing Bonsai.  He has immersed himself in Bonsai associations  which has allowed him to understand and appreciate the variation and landscape composition.

          His work is the result of a detailed observational study of nature, which can be seen in the composition and balance of loud and soft colors, producing pleasure and tranquility to contemplate.
