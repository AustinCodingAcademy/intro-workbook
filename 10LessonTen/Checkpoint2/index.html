        <p class="navy">
Serving the city of Waxahachie and surrounding areas since 1982, we provide Christian based education for Preschool 2 - 4 year olds and Kindergarten through upper grades. We want our parents and children to look forward to an interesting and challenging experience at school. We look forward to watching your student grow intellectually, physically, and spiritually as they progress in becoming a mature adult who is a contributing member of society. We believe the well-being of American values can only be perpetuated through the training and upbringing of our young people. Thank you for entrusting your student to our care.

"First Christian helped me build a strong academic and spiritual foundation that is still a big part of my life.  FCDS gave me confidence and increased my curiosity about learning because of the supportive people who know their students and expect the best from them. I will always love and NEVER forget First Christian!"

"Because I started my education at FCDS, I received a fantastic foundation for learning. It helped me graduate in the top 1% from my high school (WHS), and I graduated from SFASU with more honors than any biology student had ever had. I really owe it all to FCDS."
