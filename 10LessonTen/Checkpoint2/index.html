                <p>
                    The Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island's largest cultural organization, protects, preserves and proesents the best of Newport County's architectural heritage. Its 11 historic properties and landscapes - seven of which are National Historic
                    Landmarks - trace America's architectural and social development from the Colonial era through the Gilded Age. In keeping with its mission, the Society strives to offer its members and the public a comprehensive view of each property's
                    architecture, interiors, landscapes and social history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br> The Society is headquartered in a three-story Romanesque Revival mansion at 424 Bellevue Avenue, constructed in 1888 as a summer residence for William H. Osgood of New York. Its last private owner was Herbert Claiborne Pell, former
                    U.S. Ambassador to Portugal and Hungary. After several incarnations as a school building, the property was purchased in 1992 by the Preservation Society, which conducted an extensive restoration and renovation of the building for use
                    as its administrative headquarters.

                <h4> Marble House </h4>
                <p>Marble House was built between 1888 and 1892 for Mr. and Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt. It was a summer house, or "cottage", as Newporters called them in remembrance of the modest houses of the early 19th century. </p>

                <h4> Rosecliff </h4>
                <p>Commissioned by Nevada silver heiress Theresa Fair Oelrichs in 1899, architect Stanford White modeled Rosecliff after the Grand Trianon, the garden retreat of French kings at Versailles. After the house was completed in 1902, at a reported
                    cost of $2.5 million, Mrs. Oelrichs hosted fabulous entertainments here, including a fairy tale dinner and a party featuring famed magician Harry Houdini. </p>

                <p>The Elms was the summer residence of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Julius Berwind of Philadelphia and New York. Mr. Berwind made his fortune in the coal industry. In 1898, the Berwinds engaged Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer to design a
                    house modeled after the mid-18th century French chateau d'Asnieres (c.1750) outside Paris. </p>
