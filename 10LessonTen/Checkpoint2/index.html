                <h3>Espresso</h3>

                <p>
                    Strong black coffee made by forcing steam through dark-roast aromatic coffee beans at high pressure in an espresso machine. A perfectly brewed espresso will have a thick, golden-brown crema (foam) on the surface.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div>

                <h3>Cappuccino</h3>

                <p>
                    Combination of equal parts espresso, steamed milk and milk froth. This luxurious drink, if made properly, can double as a dessert with its complex flavors and richness.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div>

                <h3>Americano</h3>

                <p>
                    a single shot of espresso added to a cup of hot water. A creamy, rich espresso-based coffee that you can sip and savor
                </p>

            <div>

                <h3>Caf Mocha </h3>

                <p>
                    a cappuccino or a caffe latte with chocolate syrup or powder added. There can be wide variations in exactly how this is prepared, so ask us how we do it before you order.
