            <h4>Cycling is in our DNA</h4>
            <p class="pdna">
                The four decades following our inception have witnessed greater innovation than the previous four hundred. Bicycles have not been immune to this explosion in technological advancement, and Trek has been at the forefront of the movement, continually challenging
                the limits of the bicycle's capability. Our commitment to relentless innovation while honoring our founding principles to build bikes people love that we are proud to stand behind has led us to where we are today. But we know that there
                is so much more that we can do. This world needs the bicycle more today than ever before. And Trek is building a better world through this simple, elegant machine. Come ride with us.

            <p>
                Trek tri bikes aren't just highly refined, absurdly aerodynamic machines that cheat the wind, transfer all your power to the road, and carry what you need to stay on course. They're also your ticket to the final leg of the race.
