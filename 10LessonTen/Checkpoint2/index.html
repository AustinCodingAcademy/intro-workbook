            <p class="pdna">
                The four decades following our inception have witnessed greater innovation than the previous four hundred. Trek has been at the forefront of the movement, continually challenging the limits of the bicycle's capability. Our commitment to relentless innovation while honoring our founding principles to build bikes people love has led us to where we are today. But we know that there
                is so much more that we can do. Come ride with us.

            <p class="pfour">
                Trek tri bikes are highly refined, absurdly aerodynamic machines that cheat the wind, transfer all your power to the road, and carry what you need to stay on course. They're also your ticket to the final leg of the race.
