        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
        <p>
          Even though the role of developer and programmer are new skills for me I have over 26 years of diverse and challenging positions providing world-class industry-standard technology solutions.  A career that was launched in the U. S. Coast Guard and continues today blending technical expertise and organizational skills to implement project management, budget planning, design, installation and maintenance of IT solutions, well recognized for superior performance.

        <h4> Project Manager </h4>
        <p>
          I have spent the better part of the last 26 years managing projects for small to extremely large projects. The most significant role I was with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers where I spent 5-years Electrical Tech; this was the title but my role was to manage all low voltage systems to include: data, voice, public address systems, security, Nurse Call, Infant Protection and Mass Notification Systems to meet the requirements of BRAC 2005 with a total construction budget of over $3,000,000,000.00. I was responsible for design review, submittal review and approval, and completing inspections in the field for compliance to codes, standards and the design of each low voltage system.  I served as the technical expert on Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure, for both classified (SIPRNET) and unclassified (NIPRNET) networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of construction included hospitals, instructional facilities, living quarters, administration facilities, dining facilities, parking garages, and renovation of historic buildings on Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis, Randolph Air Force Base and Lackland Air Force Base.  At the height of construction I will be responsible for over 100 projects in various stages of construction.

        <p class="applications">
          Specific applications I learned and trained others to use: Microsoft Office Suite, Resident Management System (RMS), Cost Works, Dr. Checks, Engineering Knowledge Online, and SpecsIntact.
