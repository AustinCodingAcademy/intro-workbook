            <h3>If opportunity doesnâ€™t knock, build a door.</h3>
            <p>After a decade and a half working in a band that toured the country and headquartered in Los Angeles for 3 years, I have made my way to my favorite city to forge a career in web devolopment and design. My experiences with people and my desire
                to build a career as a Full Stack developer will give me the skills necessary to contribute content and innovation to the way we receive and interact with the world.</p>

            <h4>Austin Dining</h4>
            <p>I've always loved cooking and eating out wherever I am. Austin has some of the best places to eat in every price range. Some of my all time favorites are Barley Swine, Ramen Tatsuya and Bouldin Creek Cafe.</p>

            <h4>Learning</h4>
            <p>One of my main goals as a husband and father, as well as a child of the world; would be to build a career that not only affords my family the things we need and want, but also a career that challenges me to contribute to society.</p>

            <h4>Hiking and Hill Country</h4>
            <p>My favorite way to spend a day off with my wife and son is at the greenbelt or a swimming hole. I love Austin so much because even in the city limits you can emmerse yourself in nature. 20 minutes outside of the city you can get totally lost
                in the hill country. It has always inspired me.</p>

            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>My family is the most important thing to me. They give me the motivation and desire to grow and learn. Our goal has always been, as a couple, to live life everyday. Having a child is the best experience and makes living in the moment easier
                and rewarding beyond measure.</p>
