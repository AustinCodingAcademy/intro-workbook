            <h3>If opportunity doesnâ€™t knock, build a door.</h3>
            <p>After a decade and a half working in a band that toured the country and headquartered in Los Angeles for 3 years, I have made my way to my favorite city to forge a career in web devolopment and design. My experiences with people and my desire
                to build a career as a Full Stack developer will give me the motivation to build the skills necessary to contribute content and innovation to the way we receive and interact with the world.</p>

            <h4>Austin Dining</h4>
            <p>I've always loved cooking and eating out wherever I am. Austin has some of the best places to eat in every price range. Some of my all time favorites are Barley Swine, Ramen Tatsuya and Bouldin Creek Cafe.</p>

            <h4>Learning</h4>
            <p>One of my main goals as a husband and father, as well as a child of the world; would be to build a career that not only affords my family the things we need and want, but also a career that challenges me to contribute to society.</p>

            <h4>Hiking and Hill Country</h4>
            <p>My favorite way to spend a day off with my wife and son is at the greenbelt or a swimming hole. I love Austin so much because even in the city limits you can emmerse yourself in nature. 20 minutes outside of the city you can get totally lost
                in the hill country. It has always inspired me.</p>

            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>My family is the most important thing to me. They give me the motivation and desire to grow and learn. Our goal has always been, as a couple, to live life everyday. Having a child is the best experience and makes living in the moment easier
                and rewarding beyond measure.</p>

            <p>Hacking UI is a blog that ACA turned me onto. There are great articles, both technical in nature as well as more holisitic and inspirational in delivery. This one article is of particular importance to me as I am a new father at the starting
                line of a career that will prove challenging and full of sacrifice. One thing we've always said as a couple is that the sacrifices that we make will only serve to get us, as a family, closer to the goals we have set together. My professional
                goals will always take my wife, her career, our children, and our relationship into consideration. While it won't always line up, we will work to make sure that the work and life balance is always distributed in favor of life.</p>

            <p>This a story I recently found and loved. I believe the main point of the article is that as consumers we believe what we want about something. The assumption that this is the most exclusive restaurant in America is subjective. The hype is
                contrived and then scaled up to its enormous proportions by the media outlets and how they choose to write about it. In reality this is a very talented man that picks a few people to serve a week and keeps everything the restaurant does
                and is under tight secret.</p>
