            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
                Even though the role of developer and programmer are new skills for me I have over 26 years of diverse and challenging positions providing world-class industry-standard technology solutions. A career that was launched in the U. S. Coast Guard and continues
                today blending technical expertise and organizational skills to implement project management, budget planning, design, installation and maintenance of IT solutions, well recognized for superior performance.

            <h4> Web Developer </h4>
            <p>
                I am currently in school at the Austin Coding Academy studying to be a Web Developer. I will graduate from this class on September 30, 2016. I am becoming proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and how these all work together to make a responsive website.

            <h4> Project Manager </h4>
            <p>
                I have spent the better part of the last 26 years managing projects for small to extremely large projects. The most significant role I was with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers where I spent 5-years Electrical Tech; this was the title but my role was
                to manage all low voltage systems to meet the requirements of BRAC 2005 with a total construction budget of over $3,000,000,000.00. I was responsible for design review, submittal review and approval, and completing inspections in the field
                for compliance to codes, standards and the design of each low voltage system. I served as the technical expert on Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure, for both classified (SIPRNET) and unclassified (NIPRNET)
                networks.

            <h4> IT Consultant </h4>
            <p>
                I have spent eight years in the role of IT Consultant. I began as a consultant and moved up to the Studio Leader and Regional Director where I also was responsible for the entire companyâ€™s production. I designed and managed multiple projects simultaneously.
                My general responsibilities include meetings with architects, MEP consultants and stake holders to develop the requirements then incorporate the requirements into drawings and specifications. Once the projects are awarded I am responsible
                for managing the projects to ensure they are accomplished as designed. After the projects are bid I evaluate each bid and made my recommendation to the owner based on cost, experience of the contractor, and other factors. I then manage
                the projects through to completion, which includes responding to RFIs, Change Orders and negotiating costs for changes and contracts. One significant project I have managed was a $207,176,700.00 Bond project for the Schertz Cibolo Universal
                City Independent School District.

            <h4> Full Stack Programmer </h4>
            <p>
              My next pursuit will be to continue my education to achieve the knowledge to become a full stack programmer.  This will be a journey but I am excited to learn new skills to make me even more valuable to a future employer.  In the intermediate course of instruction, I will learn to use the following applications: JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, and API consumption.  After successful completion of the Intermediate Course I will pursue the Advanced course, which will be the final cog to becoming a full stack developer.  In the Advanced Course I will learn to use the following applications: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js, Passport.js, Backbone.js, Devops and deployment, Restful API and Authentication.
