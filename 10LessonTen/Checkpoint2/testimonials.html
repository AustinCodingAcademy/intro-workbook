            <p>“Picking a favorite taqueria borders along impossible, but a trip to this taco-fiending town wouldn’t be complete without a visit to Tacodeli. There’s no such thing as a bad order there, but I absolutely love the Mojo Fish Taco, The Papdulce
                and the Space Cowboy.”</p>

            <p>"Another local taco powerhouse with five locations in Austin and one in Dallas, Tacodeli has probably the most straightforward queso of the bunch. It’s light, creamy and on the runny side. And that’s it. No muss, fuss or spice. But with their
                award-winning spicy salsas as a counterpart, you can’t blame Tacodeli for keeping their queso mild. I really appreciate the simplicity because it complements any item on the menu."</p>
