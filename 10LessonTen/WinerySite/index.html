        <h2>Combining over 60 years of hard work and shared family knowledge</h2>
        <p>Our grapes can be contained by no bowl, and our feet have developed the softest soles. We strive to bring you the sweetest, juiciest, grapiest grapes this side of the pond. And did we mention our grapes are fresh? Even the Pope thinks so! Because if you don't know, now you know -- friendo.</p>
