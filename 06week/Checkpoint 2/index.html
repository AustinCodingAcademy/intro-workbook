        <p>Growing up in this city was such blessing due to it being so diverse. You get a little bit of everything! You have the lake, the hills, the country, trails and the list goes on. One thing for sure, nobody ever thought Austin would be so tech-driven. My goal is to be part of that movement- getting into the tech industry. After all, technology is our future. </p>

        <p><b>WHAT KEEPS ME GOING: </b>Growing up in my culture, the expectation was as simple as growing up to be a loving wife/mother and because of that I was not given the opportunity to further my education. I'm proud of my upbringing, but I'm a sole believer of bettering myself in order to help others, be a better friend, sister, and wife. After tirelessly working full time trying to build my life, I've been given the privilege to attend the Java Script Full Stack Web Development program. </p>
