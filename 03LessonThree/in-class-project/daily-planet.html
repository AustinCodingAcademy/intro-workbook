              <h2><u>MLB Trade Deadline</u></h2>
              <p>
                The Texas Rangers made another big move, acquiring All-Star catcher Jonathan Lucroy and reliever Jeremy Jeffress from the Milwaukee Brewers as the trade deadline closed in Monday.
The Rangers are sending outfielder Lewis Brinson, right-hander Luis Ortiz and a player to be named later to the Brewers. Texas completed the deal a day after Lucroy blocked a preliminary agreement the Brewers had to send him to Cleveland.
This is the second year in a row at the deadline that the Rangers acquired a top player who had first rejected a deal to another team. They got All-Star left-hander Cole Hamels last season after the pitcher voided a proposed trade that would have sent him from Philadelphia to Houston.
Lucroy acknowledged the trade in a tweet on Monday.
