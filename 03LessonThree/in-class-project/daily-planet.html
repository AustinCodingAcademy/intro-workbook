            <h2>Steph Curry</h2>
              <p>By JOSH DUBOW
Associated Press
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) Stephen Curry is adding a second straight MVP award to his record-setting season.
A person with knowledge of the award says Curry will be announced as the winner perhaps as soon as Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the NBA has not revealed the winner.
With his unmatched long-range shooting and slick ball-handling, Curry led the Warriors to an NBA-record 73 wins in the regular season as both he and his team somehow improved after he won the MVP and led Golden State to its first championship in 40 years the previous season.
The honor comes as no surprise as Curry has been the front-runner since early in the season. The only drama remaining is whether he will become the first player ever to win the award unanimously.
"I kind of felt bad today because I didn't tell him congratulations because I felt like I knew since December," teammate Draymond Green told reporters at a shootaround before Game 4 of Golden State's second-round series at Portland.
"It didn't feel like this momentous occasion. It didn't feel that way."
Curry led the league in scoring with 30.1 points per game and shattered his own record for 3-pointers by making 402, becoming the first player in league history to top 300 and 400 in a season.

            <h2>Uber and Lyft</h2>
            <p>AUSTIN (KXAN) — Lyft has officially paused operations in Austin as of 5 a.m. Monday morning. Uber followed shortly after suspending service in Austin at 8 a.m.

The decision for the ridesharing companies to bow out of the city comes after voters decided against Prop 1. The final numbers show 39,083 for Prop 1 and 49,158 against it. The proposition would have replaced the city’s ordinance requiring drivers to undergo mandatory fingerprint-based background checks.</p>

            <h2>China</h2>
            <p>Stock markets in China fell in Asia on Monday, after the Communist Party’s mouthpiece reported that the nation’s economy is headed for an “L-shaped” recovery, stoking worries among investors that growth in the world’s second-largest economy will moderate further.

The Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.8% to finish at 2832.11, near its intraday low, while the Shenzhen Composite Index was off 3.6% at 1804.34.

Traders were taking stock of a report Monday in the People’s Daily, which cited an “authoritative” person as saying that China’s economic growth trend would be “L-shaped” rather than “U-shaped” or “V-shaped.” Such citations in the People’s Daily have frequently been associated with views by top officials and therefore carry extra weight among market participants.</p>
