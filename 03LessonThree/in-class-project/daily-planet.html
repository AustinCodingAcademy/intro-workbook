            <h3>Steven Curry</h3>
            <p>A person with knowledge of the award says Curry will be announced as the winner perhaps as soon as Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the NBA has not revealed the winner.
              With his unmatched long-range shooting and slick ball-handling, Curry led the Warriors to an NBA-record 73 wins in the regular season as both he and his team somehow improved after he won the MVP and led Golden State to its first championship in 40 years the previous season.
              The honor comes as no surprise as Curry has been the front-runner since early in the season. The only drama remaining is whether he will become the first player ever to win the award unanimously.
              "I kind of felt bad today because I didn't tell him congratulations because I felt like I knew since December," teammate Draymond Green told reporters at a shootaround before Game 4 of Golden State's second-round series at Portland.

            <h3>Inspecting the inspectors: Redirecting funds</h3>
            <p>A KVUE Defenders investigation has uncovered millions of taxpayer dollars intended to help drivers who can’t afford to pay for repairs to pass state inspections are not going those who need it the most.

The funds are tied to the Low Income Repair and Replacement Assistant Program (LIRAP). It’s funded fees drivers pay during an inspection in Texas counties which requires emission tests, and Travis County is one of them.

Since 2012, LIRAP collected $173,536,339 from those fees. The KVUE Defenders uncovered just 28 percent, or $49.6 million, has actually gone to the drivers in need of help.

Austin resident Lee Clemons is one of those drivers who believes he could benefit from the program.</p>

          <h3>Consumers worried over U.S. economy</h3>
          <p>WASHINGTON - U.S. consumer sentiment slipped last month to lowest level since October as Americans worried the country's economic outlook, the University of Michigan says.

The university's index of consumer sentiment dipped to 91 in March from 91.7 in February. Richard Curtin, chief economist of the Michigan surveys, said consumers' dim view of the economy offset improvement in their own finances. Last month's reading was the lowest since the index registered 90 October. A year earlier, it stood at 93.</p>
