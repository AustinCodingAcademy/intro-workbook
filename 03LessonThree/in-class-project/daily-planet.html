          <h3>Prop 1 undone by campaign’s underlying motive, threatening tone</h3>

            <p>Mark McKinnon, who has worked a few campaigns out of Austin, including a couple that elected a president, tells a story about his work in 1991 for Bob Lanier, a wealthy Houston businessman who ran successfully for mayor of that city.
            </p>

            <p>McKinnon and other Lanier operatives were chewing over whether to direct money into television, mailings or a ground operation when Lanier cut off the discussion. Leaning back with his cowboy boots on the table, Lanier told his crew, “Boys, just spend it ’til you waste it.”
            </p>

            <p>Which is what Uber and Lyft just did in Austin. Other than the winning part.</p>

            <p>Losing 56 percent to 44 percent, by definition, meant the bombastic bucks went for naught, of course. But even before the votes defeating Proposition 1 rolled in Saturday evening, I was already hearing from people speculating that Lyft and Uber might have been able to put their own ride-hailing rules into the Austin City Code if they’d decided to spend only $1 million instead of $8.6 million.</p>
