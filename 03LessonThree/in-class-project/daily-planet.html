              <h2>Police arrest man accused of shooting, killing man at taco truck</h2>
              Austin police have arrested a man accused of shooting and killing another man at a North Austin taco truck early Sunday.

Police say they responded about 2:38 a.m. to a fight at a food truck in the 8600 block of North Lamar Boulevard.

Officers found three people with gunshot wounds; one of them, 39-year-old Rigoberto Jose, was declared dead on scene, police said. The Travis County medical examiner’s office ruled Jose’s death a homicide.
The other two people were transported to University Medical Center Brackenridge. Police had previously said that three people were taken to the hospital.

Witnesses told police the shooter escaped in a maroon Toyota pickup and took down the vehicle’s license plate number. Police found the vehicle was registered to a person living at a home in the 10100 block of Floyd Drive, where officers found 42-year-old Osiel Benitez Benitez, officials said.
After being identified as a suspect in the shooting, Benitez Benitez was arrested and taken to Travis County Jail. His bail was set at $225,000, jail records show.

The case remains under investigation and anyone with information on the incident is asked to call Austin police’s homicide tip line at 512-477-3588 or Crime Stoppers at 512-472-TIPS, or text “Tips 103” with a message to CRIMES.
