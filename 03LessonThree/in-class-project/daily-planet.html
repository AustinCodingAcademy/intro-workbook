                    <h3>Travis County Sheriff Shot</h3>
                    <img src="https://lintvkxan.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/hutchinson_craig-t613-e1469460862791.jpg?w=200&h=300" />
                    <p>Round Round, Texas - More than 48 hours have gone by since the shooting and killing of 54-year-old Sgt. Craig Hutchinson and there are still many unanswered questions into his death.</p>
                    <p>Round Rock police say they’re still following leads, and have received 81 tips since the shooting Monday morning.</p>
                    <p>Hutchinson, who was a 32-year veteran with the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, was shot Monday at his home in Round Rock after he radioed into his department that he saw “prowlers” in his backyard around 1:22 a.m. When officers arrived at Hutchinson’s house a few minutes later, they found him lying near a creek behind his backyard with a gunshot wound. He died at the hospital a short time later.</p>
                    <p>One of the detectives who worked side by side with Sgt. Hutchinson remembers that night when his doorbell rang.</p>
                    <p>“As soon as he opened the door he told me immediately and just your heart sinks,” Detective Mike Morton said fighting back tears. “He will be missed that is a hole in our hearts, the agency’s heart that I don’t think it’s going to be filled, I don’t see how it could be.”</p>
                    <p>Morton remembers meeting Sgt. Hutchinson in 1993, when he started with Travis County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
                    <p>“I was so young, I didn’t know,” Morton remembers after Sgt. Hutchinson told him to fix a few things. “I thought this is just some senior guy that doesn’t like the new guy and it was nothing like that, he just sort of gave you that pat on the back and said I’m doing this for a reason and this is why.”</p>
                    <p>Morton says from that day on, he looked up to the sergeant.</p>
                    <p>“When you have somebody in that position and they’re the ultimate professional, you really try to emulate somebody like that,” Morton says.</p>
                    <p>After years with the sheriff’s department, both Hutchinson and Morton ended up working side by side.</p>
                    <p>“Our cubicles backed up to each other so he sort of like was Wikipedia to us, so if we had a question, we’d go to Hutch,” Morton says. “He was a gentle giant, he was, I’m going to miss him.”</p>
                    <p>Morton is the president of the Travis County Sheriffs Law Enforcement Association (TCSLEA). He says Sgt. Hutchinson was an outstanding member of the organization.</p>
                    <p>They have set up their own donation fund to help raise money for his family here.</p>
                    <p>Over the past two days, several people and organizations have given money towards the reward for any information leading to the suspect(s) involved in the shooting. Right now, only $30,000 can be confirmed. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Round Rock Police Department tip line at (512) 671-2767.</p>
