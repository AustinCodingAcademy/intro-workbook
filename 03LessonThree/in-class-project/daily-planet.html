              <h2>UT system regents unlikely to change campus carry rules much</h2>

                <p>Campus-specific rules for carrying concealed handguns will be considered by the University of Texas System Board of Regents this week — but practically speaking, it might be difficult for the regents to change any of the rules.

                Under a state law passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature last year and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott, presidents of the state’s public institutions of higher learning were put in charge of writing the rules. Universities’ nine-member governing boards would have to muster at least a two-thirds vote to make any changes.

                Still, some UT regents might attempt a tweak or two, particularly with regard to a couple of provisions for the Austin flagship.</p>

                <p>UT-Austin appears to stand alone among the state’s more than three dozen public universities with a provision that says a license holder carrying a semi-automatic handgun on campus cannot have a chambered round of ammunition. The purpose is to reduce the possibility of accidental discharges.

                Critics say that policy defeats the purpose of the law and might even make licensees jump the gun, so to speak, in unholstering their weapons when observing an unconfirmed threat, so as to allow sufficient time to chamber a round. Two well-placed sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said this provision stands the greatest chance of being overturned by the UT board.</p>
