            <h2>5 Speaking Secrets From the Most Viewed TED Talks</h2>
            <p>TED Talks inspire and inform on many subjects, from entrepreneurship to creativity. Many of the TED Talks have racked up millions or tens of millions of views, and each of the most-viewed TED Talks serves as a master class in effective and
                compelling public speaking. 1. Why your "why." Each person who graces the TED stage shows an incredible amount of mastery of their field. They are best-in-class athletes or best-selling authors or award-winning scientists, or all three.
                And the key to achieving that level of success is a clarity of purpose and a focus on a singular mission. Tony Robbins exemplified both of these in his 2006 TED Talk, "Why We Do What We Do." Robbins is clear on his own mission, which allows
                him to speak with passion and purpose. But Robbins is also a self-proclaimed "Why Guy," helping people find their own burning passion. To convey your message powerfully and with clarity, you need to know your own "why." Whether you write
                a personal mission statement that drives all your presentations or hone in on a message for each one individually, knowing what you're aiming to achieve before your step out on the stage will help you focus your energy on that positive
                outcome. While you may not want to have your audience shoot foam darts toward the stage as Brown did, find ways to involve your audience. A show of hand is a simple way to do this but it's still fairly passive; the more active you can
                make your audience, the more invested they become in your presentation.</p>
