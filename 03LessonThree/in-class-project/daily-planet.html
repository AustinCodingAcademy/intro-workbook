        ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Even when it rains, the sun can still shine. That’s the optimistic attitude of a local auto dealer whose actions changed woman’s life and potentially saved it. Richard Newberry, owner of Spooner’s Tires and Auto, noticed a woman
        with several bags walking by his shop the past few weeks. Friday, he decided to talk to her and would soon found out the story behind a saddened face. “She started crying like breaking down after a minute or two.” “I was like I’m your friend,
        I’ve been in this boat, I’ve been where you’re at and I’ve made it through it.” The woman, Ernestina Nunez, told him she walked to work every day about a mile to Dixie Hollins High School.

        <br /> Hoping to change that, Newberry offered to sell her a car for $600. She thought about it, then said she couldn’t afford it. He lowered the price to $300-$400, but still the burden was too much. That’s when Newberry turned to his conscience for
        a decision and decided to hand her the key…for free. She denied his offer several times, which prompted him to go live on Facebook for everyone to see, he wasn’t joking around.
