                <h2><u>Windows 10 Anniversary Update takes a swing at Android notifications</u></h2>
                <p>
                    The Windows 10 Anniversary Update is out this week, and it offers an interesting mobile feature aimed not at Windows Phone, but at Android: mirrored Android notifications. The idea is that when a notification pops up on your Android phone, it should also
                    pop up on your Windows PC, allowing you to then deal with your notifications remotely on the PC. For now most of the features come with a well-deserved "beta" tag, but it's worth a look to see where this feature is and how much more
                    work needs to be done.

                    Beaming Android notifications to your PC isn't a new idea—third-party apps like Pushbullet and AirDroid can already do it, but it's still interesting that Microsoft has introduced its own first-party implementation (it's also a tacit admission that Microsoft's
                    own mobile platform is quickly fading). The way all these services work is to basically "become a really big smartwatch." The services plug in to all of the remote notification capabilities Google originally introduced for Android
                    Wear, but they're available to any app that is granted the proper permissions. We'd expect our ideal notification service to be able to do everything Android Wear can do with a notification, just inside of a PC app instead of a watch.

                    In Android 4.3, Google added a Notification API, which can mirror the entire notification panel to another device. Apps can sign up to be a Notification Listener Service, which allows the remote app to dismiss notifications on the phone and to remotely
                    press the notification action buttons. These are things like "Archive" or "Delete" for e-mails and "Reply" for e-mails, IMs, and SMSes. The transportation of these notifications all happens at the OS level and requires no developer
                    support.

                    Google also added the Remote Input API for messaging apps. After remotely pressing the "reply" button, normally this just pops up the keyboard on a phone and opens a reply dialog, which isn't very useful. The Remote Input API allows the remote device
                    to send a string of text (via voice or typing) to the device instead, and this text gets posted as a message. This is something developers specifically have to build into their apps, but most of the big messaging apps support it.
