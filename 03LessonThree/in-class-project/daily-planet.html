          <h2>Rio Olympics athletes advised to not put their heads underwater</h2>
          <p>The water is dangerous and the world's top athletes are swimming in it. Makes you wonder what the International Olympic Committee was thinking when they arranged to have the Olympics in Rio de Janiero.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Rio Olympics are kicking off on August 5th, but Rio de Janeiro’s waterways show alarming levels of pollution that could be dangerous for athletes and tourists alike. The Olympics and Paralympic aquatic venues are teeming with dangerous viruses
            and bacteria from untreated sewage, according to a 16-month-long study commissioned by The Associated Press.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The findings prompted biomedical expert Valerie Harwood to give this advice to visitors, according to the AP: "Don't put your head under water."</p>
          <p>It seems that Rio is also having to deal with Montezuma's Revenge!</p>
