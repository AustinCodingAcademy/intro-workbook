            <h3>Find someone who looks at you the way Bill Clinton looks at balloons.</h3>
            <p>Shortly after Hillary Clinton delivered her speech and officially accepted the Democratic nomination during last night’s (July 28) Democratic National Convention, balloons of all shapes and sizes (cast in the patriotic colors of red, white and blue, no less) began to rain down from the convention ceiling.
That simple moment — something that happens at pop concerts with almost nauseating predictability — was transformative and oddly humanizing for those politicians in attendance. But no one appeared more delighted than Bill Clinton, whose childlike fascination with balloons quickly became the talk of Twitter and beyond, within seconds.
Bill — who, based on his behavior, has likely never seen a balloon or even knew of their existence before last night — was left awestruck and amazed, as though his life had finally found meaning with the descent of a few thousand plastic spheres.
As the balloons continued to fill the convention, Bill’s wonderment only grew until he grabbed onto a blue-and-white balloon and held it tight, forever his.</p>
