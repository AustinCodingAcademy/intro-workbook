            <br>
            <br>
            <p>THE ZIKA VIRUS has officially arrived in the United States, as experts always knew it would. Florida Governor Rick Scott has announced that 15 people have contracted Zika from local mosquitoes in Miami. In response, the CDC put out a travel
                advisory warning pregnant women against traveling to the Zika-affected part of Miami—the first time such a warning has ever been applied to part of the continental US. And to combat the virus, Scott has requested a CDC Emergency Response
                Team to support the state’s research and blood sample collection.
                <br>
                <br>
                While that’s a good start—and Scott has been getting some criticism for not calling on the CDC sooner—it’s kind of like slapping a Band-Aid on a severed artery. An emergency
                response team simply isn’t built to attack the threat of Zika, and it’s no replacement for the federal government’s long-promised emergency funding.</p>
