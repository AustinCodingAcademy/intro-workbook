                <h2>Michael Phelps returns to Rio for one last swim</h2>
                <p>He has transcended his sport unlike anyone before him, and while his transgressions could have cost him dearly, Michael Phelps returns to the Olympics in Rio next month a changed man.</p>
                <p>The world thought they had seen the last competitive race of Michael Phelps in London.</p>
                <p>“My biggest thing once I hang up my goggles is I don’t wanna have a what if… never want to have one of those. I do not want to look back on my career and have a what if. That’s the biggest thing at the end of the day, I never want to have
                    a what if,” said Phelps.</p>
                <p>After announcing his retirement, Phelps went through some difficult times. But a drunk driving arrest lead him to a transformation. He started swimming, reconnecting with his estranged father, and started preparing for his own journey
                    as a dad.</p>
                <p>“If you think back to 2000, I was a little boy at 15, and now I am getting ready for Rio at 30. And could have my first child watch me compete for his last time,” said Phelps.</p>
                <p>In a few short weeks, Phelps’ child (along with everyone else in the world) will be able to see the greatest Olympian of all time.</p>
