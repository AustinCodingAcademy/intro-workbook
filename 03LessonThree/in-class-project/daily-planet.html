                        <td>“The stage presents things that are make-believe; presumably life presents things that are real and sometimes not well rehearsed.” — Erving Goffman, The Performance of Self in Everyday Life In putting us behind screens, social
                            media can seem as though they put us in control of our emotions. We seem to decide what we show to the world, finely curating our “selves” online. But sometimes our emotions overwhelm us, especially when they have to do with
                            loss. Whether it’s the unexpected death of a widely beloved celebrity or something more specifically personal — a breakup or a falling out with a friend — sudden emotionality can prompt tweets that feel too unprocessed to even
                            be on Twitter. But there they are nonetheless, open to anyone’s interpretation. These tweets can seem raw in their seemingly unguarded sincerity, or worse, they can seem like contrived “cries for attention,” as if seeking attention
                            is inherently shameful. But rather than measure emotional realness in terms of spontaneity, we might instead measure it in terms of interpersonal connection. Does a feeling become real only when it’s shared? And who does it
                            need to be real for in order for it to be cathartic?

                            This can be disconcerting, to have one’s feelings ranked or measurably ignored this way. As odd as it may be for your feelings to be sitting alongside someone’s retweet of a Laverne Cox tweet and an advertisement for British Airways, it feels even odder
                            for those tweets to garner more engagement. But attention metrics don’t merely throw all utterances into competition. For an emotional tweet, the metrics can make sympathy and relatability appear essentially the same. Transforming
                            sadness into textual performance and refining it to make it reverberate with the broadest possible audience is a new way to cleanse oneself of the pain by releasing it into the world, lessening one’s own feelings of isolation
                            while securing a potentially viral consolation. It is digitally native catharsis. Melissa Broder’s @SoSadToday exemplifies this type of cathartic tweeting — anguish, sadness, and fear encapsulated into single tweets that make
                            it easy to retweet and express such uncomfortable feelings as this. The humor centers the audience rather than the feeling, even as the audience’s response shows that the feeling has become expressible, tangible, understandable.
                            The “realness” of the emotions expressed are confirmed not by their intrinsic intensity or supposed spontaneity but in the reaction they get. Making an audience laugh at your feelings may thereby be among the best ways to master
                            them.
