          <h2>Web Development Apprentice</h2>
          <article>Never too late to start! I've been messing with html for a long time, since the days I was MySpacing and making HP websites. I've adapted through several different jobs, but realized I would rather stay up late and lose track of time having fun coding, other then staying up late stressed about the job I had to get up for the next morning. I really try to learn from all my mistakes, but most of all I try to listen to experienced people and learn from their mistakes! Very interested in learning everyday!
