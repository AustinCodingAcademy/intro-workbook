                        Our name reflects our philosophy about healthy living.  
                        Our approach is pure, stripped down to the basics. 
                        Rather than counting calories, measuring portions, or 
                        trying to follow the rules of restricting, trendy diets,
                        we simply focus on putting real, whole foods into your 
                        body so that you can live your healthiest, most 
                        nutritious life.<br><br>
                        <h1>BareNutrition keeps it simple by focusing on eating 
                        natural and whole foods. That's it.</h1>

                OUR PHILOSOPHY
                First things first, we all need to shift our mindset 
                on the way we think about food.  Food is what gives us 
                nourishment to take on the day and the energy to keep 
                us going.  Food is also medicine; food helps our bodies 
                heal- that is the way we need to think about the food 
                that is going into our bodies.  Contrary to popular 
                belief, the way in which your body functions is not just 
                calories in and calories out.  If you consume 100 calories 
                of fibrous fruits and veggies versus 100 calories of chips, 
                your body will process and react completely different. 
                Think about how you feel after eating something fresh and 
                light versus something packaged and processed. BareNutrition 
                keeps it simple by focusing on eating natural and whole 
                foods. That's it.

                WHY WE GOT STARTED
                BareNutrition was born when its founders, Rachel Crockett 
                and Lauren Zambito, had enough of hearing the frustration 
                from clients, friends, and family who seemed constantly 
                confused with what they should be eating to be healthy. 
                Who wouldn't be confused in a world where we are constantly 
                surrounded by conflicting messages; eat low carb high protein, 
                don't eat sugar, dairy is good, dairy is bad, fat makes us fat, 
                fat makes us healthy. People are left not knowing if they 
                should eat paleo, vegan, gluten free, raw-- the options are 
                endless. Not to mention, packaged and processed foods and foods 
                with strange ingredients or advertised "health" claims don't 
                make things easier.
