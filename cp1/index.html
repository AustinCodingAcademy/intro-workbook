      <section class="about">
        The Total Betty Salon was originated on a timeless principle: there is true beauty in all of us! This core belief is what motivates and inspires all who represent the "Total Betty Salon" culture. The salon got it's name after owner and founder Candace Cole stumbled upon an old picture of her dear Grandmother. The photo is of a stunning Veda, circa 1940. A friend commented that Veda was "beautiful, a total betty". the search for a unique, meanigful salon name had blossomed!
