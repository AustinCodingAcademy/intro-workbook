          <h3>Happy New Year!</h3>
          <p>2018 will mark Arcade UFO's 10th anniversary, and we’re starting the year off strong with plenty of new games! SFV:AE and Season 3, along with Dragonball FighterZ are now on all setups, and we’ll be hosting SFV weeklies every Friday! Be sure to follow on facebook for the latest information about events. There's also a second Jubeat cabinet now! Both have been updated to the latest version and support versus play between the two machines. </p>
          <p>But… The addition we’re most excited about is Pump It Up PRIME 2! Pump It Up is a Korean dance game, and is one of the most popular music games in the world, with dedicated fans in Korea, the Americas, and SEA. PRIME 2 is the latest version of the game, supporting online leaderboards, user profiles, and regular music additions through online updates. We have “AM PASS” cards for sale so players can make full use of all the online features! Come check it out!</p>

          <h3>Head-to-Head is back!</h3>
          <p>We’ve re-arranged the back room, and the Delta cabs are now in a head-to-head layout once again. It feels like old times! We’ve also brought in a few more cabinets: Driller G and Soul Calibur 2 are now on the floor too! There are more additions and announcements coming, stay tuned!</p>
