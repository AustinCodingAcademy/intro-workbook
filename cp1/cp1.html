            Hello, my name is Elizabeth Bustos
            <br> and I am an Interior Designer. I have
            <br> been designing the interiors of homes
            <br> as something fun and interesting to do
            <br> and then I thought about doing what I 
            <br> love most as a career and here I am!  I 
            <br> really enjoy putting smiles on people's 
            <br> faces and helping families. I first 
            <br> started helping friends and family 
            <br> members with ideas of new bathrooms,
            <br> living rooms, and my favorite, the 
            <br> bedroom; since all my peers have really enjoyed the experience they had with me, I
            <br> decided to go forth with what I love to do!
