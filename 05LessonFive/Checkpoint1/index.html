      <h1>Berries</h1>

      <p>
      Here, to the left, is a cup of beautiful berries; I don't know why they're in a cup. Are all the other dishes sitting in the sink? Was Tim too lazy to put them in the dishwasher, lazy Tim. But I digress, They look delicious but are probably covered in pesticides, horomones, maybe anthrax. Anyway under normal circumstances they would be good for you, if it wasn't for that double bacon cheese burger pizza calling to you.
