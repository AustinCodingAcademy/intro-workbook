<!--
-Create a webpage that consists of 12 different colored squares with side lengths of 50px.
-The squares should start in a vertical line in the middle of the page.
-When you hover over the squares, every other square should grow to be twice as large.
-The other squares should shrink to half their original size.
-Then the larger squares should slowly slide to the right side of the page, rotating clockwise as they move and remaining in a vertical line.
-Then the smaller squares should quickly slide to the left side of the page, rotating counterclockwise as they move and remaining in a vertical line.

-Once completed, add some transitions or translations to previous projects.

-Remember to keep them simple and subtle!
