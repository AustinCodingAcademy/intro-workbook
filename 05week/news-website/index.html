          <h1>Willie's Newest Venture</h1>
          <p>Friends, fans and fellow musicians can attest to that. For decades, as Willie and his band travelled from town to town, pot enthusiasts flocked to his shows, their pockets stuffed with offerings from their home gardens and local communities.
            They happily shared their bounty. And Willie gladly returned the favor.WILLIE'S RESERVE™ pays tribute to this tradition of sharing, caring and toking. Now that the cannabis revolution is well underway, it should come as no surprise that Willie
            is one of its most enthusiastic and committed supporters. His vision guides WILLIE'S RESERVE™.</p>

          <h1>New Spicewood Subdivision</h1>
          <p>The story of Thomas Ranch begins and ends with stewardship of the land. Protecting the range that extends unspoiled from Austin’s western edge, where its connection to the legendary Texas Hill Country begins. Over 2,200 acres of pristine terrain,
            from natural terrace to rolling valley to rocky outcrop, rich with native oaks and elms, savanna grasses and wildflowers – punctuated by a 100-foot limestone cliff overlooking the creek bed of the Pedernales River. The high point of Thomas
            Ranch is indeed a high point, rising hundreds of feet above Travis County, offering unobstructed vistas in every direction.</p>

                <h1>Briarcliff Bacon Bistro Closes</h1>
                <p>There’s an old adage, “When the Universe hands you a pig, you make BACON!” Actually, we just made that up… BUT, it’s not too far from the truth. This whole journey has been about making it up as we go along. In April 2013, after several life-changing events, the three founding partners of the BBBB - Jennifer Halpine, Robert Joseph Kinslow, and Jeff Demgen - found themselves asking, “What now?” The answer was simple…”Let’s buy our own bar!” And that’s EXACTLY how our story began. It would seem that sometimes the Universe points us in a direction. Thus, the collective quest to create an oasis of truly outstanding food, friends and environment in the greatest place possible- Spicewood, Texas -took root, and after an intense period of operational, financial and menu planning, the BBBB opened its doors in July of 2013. We present to you, our customers, our labor of love (with a side order of BACON!), and we sincerely hope that your experience at the BBBB is as exceptional as the time that we have had creating this vision come to life. Thank you for visiting the BBBB, and a VERY SPECIAL bow of appreciation to all of our loyal customers who have been such ardent supporters of our efforts.</p>
