          <p>Who would of thought that this beautiful building was owned by Elvis Presley here in Austin, TX. Not much was known at the time that BAC Clinics bought the building from a third party. BAC will not disclose how much it payed for the property
            or any market offerings the property was given. At this time all we know is that BAC has started operations at this new site.</p>

            this problem grow. There are many organizations that need your help. All you have to do is start participating to help the community.</p>
