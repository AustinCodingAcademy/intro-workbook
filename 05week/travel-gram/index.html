            <div class="descOne">I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Here we're limited by the time we have. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things. And right there you got an almighty cloud. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</div>

            <div class="descTwo">I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.</div>

            <div class="descThree">Maybe there's a little something happening right here. With practice comes confidence. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. There it is. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.</div>

You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. It's hard to see things when you're too close. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Just go out and talk to a tree.</div>

Let's have a happy little tree in here. At home you have unlimited time. You can do anything your heart can imagine. </div>

It's fun. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. </div>

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it.</div>
