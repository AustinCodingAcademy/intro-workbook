    <h1>SOME OF OUR FRIENDS...</h1>
<h2 class="quote">I have nothing but positive things to say about Steve and his team. My dog Hobbes loves his walks and I love knowing he is taken care of. The email confirmations and daily pictures are also awesome!!!! Highly recommend.
<br>— Tawanda J.</h2>
<h2 class="quote">We are so hapy to have found Steve!! Very friendly, pics of our baby every time they went out and GPS to track the walk! Felt very secure with our dog in his hands. Would highly recommend
<br>— Amy R.</h2>
<h2 class="quote">Well I definitely made the right call with Let’s Walk Austin. The reports they offer for each walk are great - they even use GPS tracking, which is pretty nifty. I also really love how they include a photo with each visit - it makes me so happy to see my buddy looking so happy while I’m stuck at work. Definitely give them a try!
<br>— Megan M.</h2>
<h2 class="quote">As a long-term client I couldn’t be more pleased. They’ve always been reliable and easy to work with. I love the new GPS tracking system too! I get a photo and a note everyday showing my happy, healthy pup enjoying the Austin sunshine. :-)
