        <h2>Local Woman Finds Success in Web Development</h2>
        <p>Melissa Brimer, 28, wanted to find a way to get ahead in her career and ultimately her way of life. She turned to web development as a way to accomplish this.</p>
        </br>

        <p>Melissa graduated from Texas State in 2011 where she studied Communication Design. Since graduation, she has been working as a print and web designer at a small boutique design firm in Austin, TX. While designing responsive websites, she often
          found that the developers didn't quite fabricate the design as she had hoped. This could be the fact that the firm doesn't have an in-house developer which can hinder communication and allow for pieces to get lost in translation. However, hesitant
          to leave the job due to an amazing work-life balance, she decided a way to fix this was to learn to code herself. </p>
        </br>

        <p>After her boyfriend took the course and found a new (or second) career himself, she decided it was time to take the plunge. The ultimate goal is to work for herself, alongside her boyfriend, and offer fully responsive web design and development
          to small businesses.</p>
        </br>

        <p>That goal is still in the works, but Melissa is having a much better time creating open conversations with her developers and taking on the front-end coding duties herself. This has made her more passionate about going to work everyday and has
          helped her gain a substaintial raise.</p>
