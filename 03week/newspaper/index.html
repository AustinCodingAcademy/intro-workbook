                        Local legend <em>Sabrina Lau-Marquez</em> has made it to the top of the charts! SLM.COM is now one of the fastest growing Internet domain registrar and web hosting companies. Her main focus are mobile sites concentrating on working with the food industry. It has been so intense that servers have crashed!
                        <br></br> As Sabrina has built up her business she plans on building it up some more.  There has been rumors of becoming a publicly trading company and expanding the current space to where Google resides!  And with all that excitment she is adding more jobs and working with local schools to get student internships at SLM.COM.

                                Arrest made in Karina Vetrano case, helped by DNA evidence, NYPD says. <br></br>Chanel Lewis, 20, has been linked to the case by DNA evidence, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said during a press conference in Ozone Park,
                                Queens, on Sunday.<br></br>
                                Lewis was picked up by investigators in the East New York area Saturday evening, police said. “This is a very good day for justice in New York City,” said Boyce, who added that police followed some 250 leads in the case. “It was a tremendous effort on
                                the part of the NYPD over the last sixth months.”<br></br>Vetrano, 30, went for a run around 5 p.m. on Aug. 2 near her Howard Beach home. A few hours later, her body was found face down in a marshy area, about 15 feet from a trail near 161st Avenue and 78th Street in Spring Creek Park, police said.<br></br>Investigations turned to Lewis recently, according to Boyce. A profile developed through a 911 call of a suspicious person in the area of the park that was phoned in in May — months before the attack. Boyce said investigators happened on the call during a “deep dive” into the case.<br></br>Police first spoke with Lewis on Feb. 2. Lewis cooperated during that visit, allowing police to take a swab of his DNA, Boyce said.
Lewis' DNA matched samples police had recovered from Vetrano’s neck, under her fingernails and on her cellphone — all evidence that Vetrano put out a ferocious fight against her attacker.
Police then moved in, arresting Lewis outside his home around 6 p.m. Saturday.

                        An encampment of volunteer lawyers waited at Kennedy Airport’s international arrivals terminal Saturday to check whether the Trump administration is obeying a federal judge’s order suspending a nationwide ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations.<br></br>
                        Flights began landing Saturday with passengers from one or more of those countries — Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, lawyers’ group spokesman Alan Kaplan said.
