  <div class="para1">
    <br><br><p>Riley Floyd, a 26 year old University of Texas graduate, has been pondering a career change for some time. After his graduation, he had a tough time figuring out what he wanted to do with his life. This is not uncommon for most recent college grads. He ended up moving to the mountains of Colorado. For six months he lived the easy life in Winter Park.</p></div>
      <div class="box"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/7/005/08c/372/3dfdf8b.jpg" id="pic"/> <h3 id="quote"><br><br>"I found myself daydreaming<br> about being in a city where I could<br>be creative and make a difference."</h3></div>
      <div class="para2">
       <br><br><p>Working as a lifeguard manager at a small resort was a simple task that revolved around a simple life. When he was not working he could be found on the slopes snowboarding. Eventually this life became unfulfilling. He packed his things and moved back down to his hometown of Tyler, Texas. </p><p><br>He began working for a Real Estate company and recieved his Realtor's license. This was also not the work Riley felt he could enjoy. "I found myself daydreaming about being in a city where I could be creative and make a difference.", Floyd says. Creativity was something he felt he needed in a career and so he packed up again and moved back down to his college city of Austin, Texas.</p><p><br> This was a town where music and arts florished with a nice scenic view of accompaniment. Although the job market was not an easy one, he quickly found a job working as an Ad Operations Analyst at Facebook as a contractor. This was a job he thoroughly enjoyed. Going to work no longer felt like a burden. Realizing that there was not much room to grow in this newly found position, he began to look for work where he could combine craetivity with a much needed skill. He had always had an interest in design and video game development. Developing games would require quite a bit of problem solving while still considering the design that is involved. Looking to start developing his skills, he set his sights on coding and signed up for Austin Coding Academy. The rest was history. To begin, he would learn how to design and create websites through HTML and CSS. After that he would move on the learn JavaScript. He is currently working towards becoming a full-stack developer. </p> </div>
