           Local Woman Finds Success in Web Development
         </h2>
         <p class="article-content">
           <br>
           Christine Tsai already had a career working in software design but wanted to expand her skills to engineering. After moving from New York City to Austin, Texas for a job at IBM, Christine now works on a ten-person design system team. Originally, the team created and maintained the design system for Bluemix, a platform as a service product, but is now looking to expand their reach to other products and services within IBM. Part of the research and design process in creating new components has to do with speaking with engineers and learning about their needs when consuming a component library and using the design system.
           <br><br>
           Through her meetings with stakeholders and design system users, Christine began to see a knowledge gap in her ability to design for engineers when she did not have a deep technical background. After some encouragement from her teammates, she decided to take a 10-week night course focusing on front-end development, with the goal to better understand a developer’s workflow and practice coding herself.
           <br><br>
           Upon finishing the course at Austin Coding Academy, Christine was able to immediately contribute back to her team. Contribution started small at first—such as checking code, refactoring, and helping code basic components, but as she gained a deeper understanding she was able to participate in more conversations and be more involved in the front-end development side of the team. Now, thanks the the jump-start from Austin Coding Academy, Christine now uses her front-end knowledge to create better solutions.

               Yes, All This Happened. Trump's First 2 Weeks As President
             </h2>
             <p class="article-content">
               A controversial immigration ban, feuds over inauguration crowd size, unfounded allegations of voter fraud and a Supreme Court nominee: highlights of Trump's first two weeks in office.
               <br><br>
               President Trump's first two weeks in office have been a sprint, not the start of a marathon. If the rapid pace and, sometimes, hourly developments of executive orders, news, controversies and more have left you exhausted, you're not alone. If you're finding it hard to remember just everything that's transpired too, we're here for that, too.
