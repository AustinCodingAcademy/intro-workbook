            <p> Eric Nogelmeier, a Eunice local, has defied the odds and escaped his oilfield roots.Although making websites since a teenager he re-realized his dream of one day becoming a web developer, years after completing college.</p>
            <p>Starting at Austin Coding Academy in January of 2017, he spent 5 days a week studying and building webpages, struggling week after week to learn the basics and turn it into a viable career. After learning the basics, he started to network, perform in hackathons, freelanced websites and volunteered to work in other groups to gain experience</p>
            <p>Eric now enjoys what he does, no longer having to smell like gasoline and oil everyday. In fact he loves his work and his life.</p>
