              <p>Greg Mitchell, Stanley Marsh, Ziggy Hood, and Ryan Palmer. These are all names that have become synonymous with Amarillo. And now here's another one. Juan Mata. If you ever had the pleasure of working with Juan then you knew he was a very hard working, passionate teacher. It was this passion that would help propel him into the field of EdTech.</p>
              <p>Juan graduated from Canyon's West Texas A&amp;M in 2013 and taught for Borger ISD for a year before moving to Austin. It's here where Juan soon realized his potential. He taught math and science at Cedar Creek Elementary for three years after his move. Even though he loved teaching, he was hoping to find a way to reach and help even more students than those in his classroom.</p>
              <p>Living in the tech hub that is Austin, Texas, it didn't take long before Juan found his opportunity for a greater calling through web development. Juan joined Austin Coding Academy, where he learned the ins and outs of the coding world. It was through this nine month journey that Juan was introduced to <a href="https://www.penpalschools.com/" target="_blank">PenPal Schools</a>. </p>
              <p>It's here that he now works in an environment that reaches over 100,000 students in over 170 countries across the globe. Along with other programmers, Juan helps develop math and science programs that help connect and foster collaboration between students from different countries. He hopes to continue to reach even more students as he continues his journey of helping as many young minds as possible.</p>
