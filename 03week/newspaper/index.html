          <div class="article-content">
              <p>Bay Area native, J.D. Rowlett, has found great success in the tech industry’s hottest sector: web development. Born and raised in Santa Clara, Mr. Rowlett moved to Austin, Texas, in 2015 where he has become a major player in Austin’s flourishing tech sector.</p>
              <p>“He was a true leader before ever considering a career in tech” said Richard Der of Santa Clara, who grew up with Mr. Rowlett. Mr. Der and Mr. Rowlett went to school together and were in the Boy Scouts together, both becoming Eagle Scouts in 2003.</p>
              <p>Growing up, Mr. Rowlett was a leader in school functions, organizing people for fundraisers and taking charge on countless community projects that his Boy Scout Troop worked on. After graduating from Western Kentucky University with a degree in Communications, Mr. Rowlett moved back to the Bay Area where he found work as a contractor for Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Brett Kastner is a former supervisor of Mr. Rowlett. "He was a team lead for business operations and always did great work for us” Mr. Kastner said. Both men worked at Google and Apple together.</p>
              <p>After moving to Austin and marrying his wife, Rebecca, Mr. Rowlett was working for his father-in-law as an operations assistant. With the threat of a layoff looming Mr. Rowlett explains how his career began to change. “I knew I needed to up my skill-set and I began looking at Austin Coding Academy. I knew that coding was the last great in-demand skill and so I signed up for the next class.”</p>
              <p>But Mr. Rowlett’s career change didn’t stop there. "I was sitting in a hotel in Las Vegas thinking about being laid-off. I had been using Lyft a lot on this trip and thought to myself, ‘With all of these conferences going on everyday at so many hotels, why can’t I open my LinkedIn mobile app and see a filtered list of who my best contacts would be to network with?’” Thus started Mr. Rowlett’s first company, <a href="https://www.mygridapp.co/">Grid, Inc,</a> a mobile messaging app that allows users to connect with people around them who would be relevant to their professional network. “When you go to a job fair, conference or other networking event, often times you don’t know who to talk to. Who is best to talk to, who should I be networking with? Grid offers a list of the people who are relevant to your network who are also in the same location.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Rowlett has not been without competition in this space but he has competed well. He is now building on his nominal success with Grid and offering more location-based marketing services to business customers. The Rowlett Organization is now a conglomerate of highly profitable enterprises providing tech products and services to businesses and individuals. The company is now building a new platform for location-based marketing similar to the social media marketing platform of HubSpot. With a market space $27 billion and an 8.8% growth projected from 2015 to 2020, Mr. Rowlett is assured of his capitalist risks and is optimistic about the future. “The greatest risk is not taking one” Mr. Rowlett said.</p>
