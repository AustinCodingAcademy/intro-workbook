        <h1>Introducing The New Reference Pure Drumset!</h1>
        <p>
          Pearl's Reference Pure proudly builds upon the legacy started by Pearl's original Reference Series Drums by using the exact shell composition formula, the same number and type of wood plies, and the same targeted task specific bearing edges to create a thin shell, highly resonant, lower mass version of the original. <br><br>
          We start the process by choosing thinner plies of prized Maple, hand selected Birch and rare African Mahogany. While Reference drums use a rotating combination of both 1.6mm and .9mm wood plies in its shell construction, the Reference Pure uses only .9mm thick plies in its construction. The result is a thin, resonant, extremely vibrant yet powerful near-field experience for the player with the wonderful accentuation effects of Birch and African Mahogany placed exactly where they are needed most.<br><br>
          To maintain maximum resonance, Pearl's Reference Pure features our super low-mass elegantly designed STL Tube Lugs and our thin Fat Tone Hoops with our exclusive hemmed and welded edge resulting in a hoop that is both lightweight and extremely strong to further promote maximum resonance.<br><br>
          For those looking for a thin shell alternative to our legendary Reference Series drums, your wait is over.<br><br>
          Reference Pure. Pure Tone. Pure Resonance. Pure Perfection.

        <h1>Please Welcome Trevor Charnquist, Our Newest Addition To The Pearl Family!</h1>
        <p>
          We discovered this drum virtuoso at an outdoor festival in Texas.  Tall as an oak with dark blonde waist lenth hair, Trevor sits atop his throne, posed as a king before his audience.  His ride work alone merits mention and then he goes and throws all variety of monster polyrythms in the mix!  His riffs are Peart-like to say the least and he's got Portnoy influences to boot!!    This is one to watch on Pearl Drums!!!<br><br>

          Hailing from Austin, Texas, known by some to be the Live Music Capital of the World, Trevor has had music around him since birth.  His father was a professional musician in a rock band and who still plays gigs to this day.  <br><br>

          After his work with Infinite Echoes, he decided to do his own concept album.  He gave that first solo project the name Waking Europa, after his favorite celestial body.  Trevor's talent has woken US up here at Pearl!  Give him a listin on Spotify and get his debut album on Amazon or itunes.
