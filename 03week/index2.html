        <h1 id="news">Suspect Arrested in Quebec Mosque Shooting</h1>
         <p>
          A French-Canadian university student was the sole suspect in a shooting
         at a Quebec City mosque and was charged with the premeditated murder of
          six people, Canadian authorities said on Monday, in what Prime Minister
           Justin Trudeau called "a terrorist attack."
           Court documents identified the gunman in the attack on Sunday evening prayers
           as Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, and charged him with six murder counts and five
           counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon. The slightly-built Bissonnette
            made a brief appearance in court under tight security wearing a white prison
            garment and looking downcast.  Prosecutors said all of the evidence was not yet
            ready and Bissonnette, a student at Université Laval, was set to appear again on
             Feb. 21. No charge was read in court and Bissonnette did not enter a plea.
           "The charges laid correspond to the evidence available," said Thomas Jacques, a
            representative of the prosecutor's office, when asked why Bissonnette was not
            charged with terrorism-related offences.nnAmong the six men killed were a
            butcher, a university professor, a pharmacist and an accountant, according to
             police and Canadian media.
