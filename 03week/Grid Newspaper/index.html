                <p><span>H</span>OMESTEAD, FL—Marveling at the amount of tension his prey
                   seemed to be carrying around with him, a 12-foot-long Burmese
                   python was reportedly shocked Wednesday at how much stress a
                   local man was holding in his gradually constricting neck.
                   “Geez, it’s like one huge knot in there,” said the 300-pound
                   reptile, also noting as it coiled itself with increasing force
                    around the man’s torso that his shoulders were “like rocks—just
                  giant lumps of tightness.” “He must be having a tough time
                  at work or something. This can’t be healthy. Seriously, this
                  is the kind of stress that gives you a heart attack at
                   age 40.” At press time, the python expressed relief that
                  the man seemed to have very abruptly become completely relaxed.
