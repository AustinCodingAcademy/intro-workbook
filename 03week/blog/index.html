            Creating a Believer
          </h2>
          <p class="article-content">
            Throughout the years, one band has stayed with me. Has guided me. Has lifted me. That band is The red Hot Chili Peppers. From my youth to my adulthood, I have listened faithfully. I was introduced to most music through my brother. He was the one to buy the cds, and the first to truly show me the magic of music. Being a typical little brother, I often snooped through his things. This paid off for me one day, as I came across an album that changed my way of thinking and saturated my musical palate. This album was "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". Since then I have never looked back; purchasing every RHCP album that has been released to this day.

                Plastic Beach
              </h2>
              <p class="article-content">
                My love for music steadily grew throughout high school. During this time period, I began to learn several instruments so I could mimic my heroes. One such hero was Damon Albarn from The Gorillaz. This led to me learning to use synths and record my own music. No album has influenced my electronic music more than Plastic Beach. It is a near perfect album in every aspect of the word.</br></br>

                Beck
              </h2>
              <p class="article-content">
                Seeing Beck live in 2009 is something I will never forget. From the band's stage presence, to his use of turntables in the song "Where its At", I was blown away. His newest ablum, Morning Phase, won a grammy for album of the year and rightfully so. It is one of my top ten favorite albums of all time.
