            DOJ Files Notice To Appeal Ruling That Blocks Trump's Immigration Order
          </h2>
          <p class="article-content">
            The Trump administration plans to appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the Feb. 3 ruling by Judge James Robart in Washington state.
            <br><br>
            On Friday night, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily halted the enforcement of President Trump's executive order on immigration. By Saturday, federal officials had announced they would be complying with the ruling, and airlines said they would resume boarding travelers covered under the ban.

                Yes, All This Happened. Trump's First 2 Weeks As President
              </h2>
              <p class="article-content">
                A controversial immigration ban, feuds over inauguration crowd size, unfounded allegations of voter fraud and a Supreme Court nominee: highlights of Trump's first two weeks in office.
                <br><br>
                President Trump's first two weeks in office have been a sprint, not the start of a marathon. If the rapid pace and, sometimes, hourly developments of executive orders, news, controversies and more have left you exhausted, you're not alone. If you're finding it hard to remember just everything that's transpired too, we're here for that, too.
