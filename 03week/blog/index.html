                            New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park. Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit Times Square. <br></br> Once most notable for its slums and tenements but now home to the coolest bars in New York City, the Lower East Side has blossomed into a Manhattan must-do. Years ago this neighborhood was considered by some to be a no-go series of blocks, but a recent revitalization has distilled the gritty, edgy fun of New York into a walkable, condensed area where anything now seems possible.<br></br>Brooklyn, one of New York City’s 5 boroughs, sits on the western end of Long Island. The iconic Brooklyn Bridge, built in 1883, connects it to Manhattan. Neighborhoods range from high-end DUMBO (between Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges); Williamsburg, a hotbed of indie music, art and nightlife; to beachfront Coney Island and its amusement parks. Leafy, row house–filled districts include Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope.

                          The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC;[2] these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall.
