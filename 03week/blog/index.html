          Top of Africa!
        </h2>
        <p class="article-content">
        At 19,341 ft. Mt. Kilimanjaro stands as the highest point in Africa and the tallest free standing mountain in the world. Making it to the top had been on bucket list for a while and in summer of 2015 I hired Abakombe tours to guide me to the top. Mt. Kilimanjaro is a mountain where you have to use local guides. I definitely could not have made it to the top without my team and especially without my guide Jimmy. "Pole Pole is swahili for Slowly Slowly. It is repeated constantly to remind you to take your time and pace yourself."
</br> </br> I chose to do the 7 day Machame route. You start at around 5400 feet and on the morning of the 6th day reach the peak. The first night on the mountain, I was not very confident on making it to the top cause the day was a lot harder than expected. At the end of each...

              Grand Canyon
            </h2>
            <p class="article-content">
              This was my first visit to the Grand Canyon and it did not disappoint. I was on a 3 week road trip with my girlfriend at the time, now Fiance. We were lucky enough to find a primitive campsite right outside of the Grand Canyon in the Kaibab National Forest. I was shocked that it was free. Granted there were no bathrooms or showers but we had plenty of room to pitch a tent, put up our hammocks, and make a fire pit without being disturbed by any nearby neighbors like the over crowded campgrounds inside the Grand Canyon.

              Even though I have only been to a few this was by far my favorite park. Hiking the narrows was awesome and we only went a couple miles of the 16 total.
