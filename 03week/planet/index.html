          An archaeologist has launched a citizen science project that invites anyone with an Internet connection to help look for evidence of archaeological site looting. The platform, called GlobalXplorer, presents users with satellite images of Earth's surface. "Looting is one of the most common ways archaeological sites around the world are destroyed," explains the archaeologist behind the project, Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p>

          "By marking satellites where you think you see looting, you're helping to protect sites and save our common cultural heritage."</p>

          Parcak is a space archaeologist, meaning she specializes in what satellite images can tell us about past civilizations. The GlobalXplorer project is funded with the $1 million TED Prize that Parcak won last year. She explained early plans for the project to NPR's Ari Shapiro last year. People who log on to the site are shown square satellite images of the Earth's surface — the current area they are crowdsourcing is in Peru — and are asked to decide whether there is or is not evidence of looting pits on the ground.</p>
