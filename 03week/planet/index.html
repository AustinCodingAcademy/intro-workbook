            <p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that the New England Patriots will travel to Mexico City to face the Oakland Raiders in 2017. ESPN had the initial report two months ago, but the game is now confirmed by the league.
            <p>The Raiders will be considered the “home team” on the road, while the Patriots will be the “road team.” The Raiders “hosted” the Houston Texans in Mexico City this past season.</p>

            <p><blockquote><b>"I think it’s funny that Mexico City gets the Raiders, Texans, and Patriots- three playoff teams- while the London International Series gets the football equivalent of vomit."</p></blockquote></b>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>“Right now we’re leaning towards a Sunday game,” Goodell said, explaining that the Raiders and Texans teams struggled with travel and preparation for the following week after a Monday Night game.</p>
