          <p>  Along with being one of the internet’s favourite memes, Nicolas Cage has given some spectacular performances over his career. Yet, people’s opinions on Cage vary hugely. Some believe the actor to be spectacular, a crazed genius who gives everything his all. Others dislike his maniacally differing performances. What we can all agree on, though, is Cage’s brilliance when interacting with fans.</p>
          <p>Most recently, the Oscar winner appeared at Nic Cage celebration, titled CAGED. Put on by the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, the organisers have invited Cage along every year since its inception four years ago, the festival taking place every January - Cage’s birth month.In a surprising twist, the Face/Off actor crashed the event, sitting through a selection of his own films, Bangkok Dangerous, Joe, Bringing Out the Dead, Army of One and Lord of War (chosen by him), then proceeded to do a 47-minute question and answer session.</p>
          <p>To top it all of, Cage gave a 10-minute reading of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story The Tell-Tale Heart, becoming increasingly dramatic throughout. A treat for all in attendance.</p>
