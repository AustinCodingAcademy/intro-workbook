<h1><img src="./vegan bbq.jpg"><p>Where Was the Idea of Texas Vegan BBQ Born?</h1>
 <p>What can be more Texas than BBQ? Well, as a vegan from Chicago I have been able to find a number of delicious vegan options in the city of San Antonio as well as Austin, but sadly I found many were lacking in food quality and taste, and portions were small for the cost. Food trucks in particular lacked in options, and the options they did have were lacking taste, quality, and even just fresh ingredients. I think to myself, does it really take that much to sauté up a little garlic or some fresh veggies? I paid $8 for a veggie fried rice that clearly had frozen mixed vegetables in it.</p>

<p>In my quest to introduce meat free options to as many as will listen to me, and out of concern for our health, animals, and the planet I have decided to introduce TEXAS VEGAN BBQ!! We are a small eat in/take out establishment with the focus on great food, prices, and service!! Our goal down the road is to beat out Bill Miller!! (JK although that would be a dream!!)</p>

<p>We do dine in, take out, delivery, and catering and also plan to have a food truck out and about town. This is important to me as I feel food truck options are lacking in this great city.</p>
 <h1>Tell Me About Your Food</h1>
 <p>As a commitment to the local area, we source as much as we can locally. Produce, beverages, etc. If we can get it locally, we will. For many reasons eating local is just better. Local produce ensures you get the vitamins and nutrients that your body needs in the right season for where you live, and in addition it is a more environmentally sound practice as it cuts down on pollution and fuel consumption related to delivery of produce/fruits not local or in season. We may vary our veggies from time to time depending on what is in season at the time.</p>

<p>We source our “meats” from a company in Minneapolis, MN called Herbivorous Butcher. You can see their website <a href="https://www.theherbivorousbutcher.com">here.</a></p>

<h1>About the Owner</h1>
<p>My name is Julie Adams, born and raised in Chicago. My interest in veganism and animal rights comes from a young age. At 8 a friend of my mothers came to visit with her daughter that was the same age as me. We were actually born the same day as our mothers met in the hospital while giving birth to us. She was a vegetarian and I had decided I wanted to be as well and expressed this idea to my parents. I was just told “you will eat what is put in front of you” and that was kind of the end of that at my tender age of 8. When I was 16 I actually became vegetarian with another friend of mine from grade school. When I went to college as an Animal Science major, I was tasked with selecting a topic for my 1st semester project. I decided on Animal Rights, and my eyes were opened to many things throughout the project, even things I observed as far as the treatment of the animals on the campus farm. I never ate eggs as I just have a disdain for them since birth, and never drank milk past childhood, maybe just an occasional piece of cheese or pizza, which I gave up years ago when I found out how bad dairy was for your health, actually worse than meat, and that the dairy industry involved more cruelty than the meat industry. I decided to give dairy up.</p>

<h1>Our Goal</h1>

<p>Our goal is of course to provide more vegan options for San Antonio residents, but we also want to see meat eaters enjoying our food (and hopefully win them over as converts!). We want to appeal to everyone including children. We want to see everyone back for a 2nd or 3rd or more visit!! That is the true indicator of a good restaurant, if people return multiple times!! Please feel free to submit any comments or suggestions.</p>
