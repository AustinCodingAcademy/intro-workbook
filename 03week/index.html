        <p>Austin Coding Academy offers part-time coding programs for
          professionals either for new careers or career improvement.
          Rather than some full-time coding classes, ACA offers classes two
          times a week with weekend study programs. Tuition is also cheaper
          than other coding schools.</p>
          <p>ACA has been operating in Austin for several years, and
            recently launched in the San Antonio market, said co-founder
            Chris Sica. For the Houston launch, ACA plans to focus on
            connecting with the city's big industries: energy and health
            care.</p>
            <p>An Austin coding school will expand to the Houston market next
              month aiming to better train Houston's tech workforce.</p>
