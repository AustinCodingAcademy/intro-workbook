            <h3>  The Real Reason Brad and Angelina divorced </h3>
            <img src="https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/epa_file_france_cinema_jolie_pitt_divorce_85377836.jpg" alt "Brad and Angelina">
<p>After two short years of marriage, but many more together, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have announced their divorce. While that may be public knowledge, the inside scoop about what led up to it has been revealed by the most in the know gossip scholars in the world.

Although all gossip needs to be taken with a grain of salt, here are the seven latest explanations for the divorce.
1. A private investigator Angelina hired found proof that Brad was sneaking around with Marion Cotillard.

<p>Page Six reports that the end to this famous relationship comes due to an affair between Pitt and Cotillard, a very attractive woman who stars with him in the movie Allied. Whether this is just supposition because she is beautiful and conveniently on set with him, or there is more detailed information is a matter of speculation at this point.</p>

Parenting differences caused an insurmountable rift.

<p>TMZ did speak about the potential relationship with Cotillard but also cited different attitudes toward parenting between the two. I don't find this claim very trustworthy because it seems like they are trying too hard to convince people it is the only reason.</p>
