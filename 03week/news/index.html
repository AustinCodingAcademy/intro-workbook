            <h3>Fighting the STEM gender gap with stories of trailblazing
              female scientists</h3>
            <p>For writer and illustrator Rachel Ignotofsky, the idea to
              profile 50 pioneering female scientists in her recent book,
              “Women in Science,” was spurred by conversations with educator
              friends. As they talked about the gender gap in science,
              technology, engineering and math fields, Ignotofsky realized
              women aren’t just underrepresented in STEM, itself — the stories
              about their contributions don't get much play, either... </p>

            <h3>Barks and bytes: the rise of wearable tech for pets</h3>
            <p>We are becoming a species obsessed with data. Not content
              with monitoring our own sleeping, eating and exercising habits,
              many of us could soon be tracking the lives of our pets, too.
              Where did your cat go last night? How many calories did your dog
              eat today? What is your snake thinking? Knowing the answers to
              such questions – well, the first two, anyway – is becoming ever
              easier, and the advantages of doing so are increasing... </p>

            <p>Nintendo released Donkey Kong 64 in 1999, which means gaming
              enthusiasts have had plenty of time to perfect their
              run-throughs. Collecting every last one of the game’s 976 banana
              coins is no small feat, but Twitch user Isotarge recently
              achieved something even more impressive. As Kotaku reports, the
              speedrunner uncovered a 977th coin that’s been hidden in the
              game’s code for more than 17 years...</p>

            <h3>Why Millennials Have Become the Wanderlust Generation</h3>
            <p>Millennials have long garnered a reputation as the tech-savvy
              and sharing economy driven generation. Above all, millennials
              want to connect to others and the world in an authentic way.
              They push boundaries, they map out their own itineraries and
              they prioritize staying in local neighborhoods rather than
              cookie-cutter hotels. In fact, according to population estimates
              from the U.S. Census Bureau, there are more than 83 million
              millennials in the country. Aside from representing one of the
              most lucrative segments of the travel market, millennials also
              happen to have a strong desire to plan trips. Here's a look at
              millennial travel trends and how the wanderlust generation is
              redefining the travel landscape as we know it...</p>
