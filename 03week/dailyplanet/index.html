          <h3>Here's Why Superman Is The Ultimate Symbol For Hope</h3>
          <h5>Nate Brinkley<br>
            January 30, 2017 at 06:37AM</h5>
          <p>Superman is one of the most popular characters in pop culture;
          and ever since his debut on April 18, 1938, he has been inspiring
          readers, listeners, and viewers to reach for the sky. His character
          has given hope to many, and there are several reasons he can be
          considered the ultimate symbol for hope in fiction!
          </p>
          <img src="super.jpg"/ id="superpic">
          <p>
          <strong>His Heritage</strong><br>
          Unless you've lived under a rock all your life, you know that
          Superman is the Last Son of Krypton. He was raised on Earth, but
          is an alien by birth. This is one of the aspects that made his
          character so relatable then, and still resonates with fans today.
          How many of us have felt like outcasts, like we are alone in this
          world? These are issues that Superman stories have dealt with for
          generations. So many have read about the outcast from another
          planet with great abilities, who finds his place in the world, and
          they have escaped into those stories and been challenged to do the
          same themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>His Power</strong><br>
          Superman is known for his vast array of abilities. He has so many,
          I'm not sure I could begin to name all of them here. The abilities
          that seem to be his main power set are:
          <ul>
            <li>Super Strength</li>
            <li>Super Speed</li>
            <li>Flight</li>
            <li>Heat Vision</li>
            <li>X-Ray Vision</li>
            <li>Freeze Breath</li>
            <li>Invulnerability</li>
            <li>Accelerated Healing Factor</li>
          </ul>
          These abilities are given to Superman through absorbing the radiation
          of the yellow sun. Many have criticized him, saying that he is an
          overpowered superhero, but I argue that all these abilities are
          fundamental to his character. Superman instills hope because he is
          constantly faced with obstacles, and he somehow digs down and finds a
          way to overcome those challenges. Even in the New 52: Superman #38,
          Superman faced a new obstacle and developed a new ability: the super
          flare. This is why Superman wears the symbol for hope on his chest:
          He has an innate ability to overcome every obstacle he faces. We are
          able to look up to his character because he has all these incredible
          powers –– he could literally take whatever he wanted –– and yet he
          chooses to use these abilities for the benefit of others, not himself.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>His Humanity</strong><br>
          We look up to Superman because he is something of an outcast; we look
          up to him because he has an amazing ability to overcome the most
          daunting obstacles; and we look up to him because, despite all this,
          he still faces our everyday human struggles.This was a quality that
          was notably absent in the New 52 version of the character; it seemed
          that Superman was fine being the mega-powered individual that he was.
          Superman may have been born as Kal-El on a distant planet, but he was
          raised as Clark Kent by two down-to-earth, country folks. They
          instilled the moral and human qualities that make Superman a relatable
          character.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br>
          There are many things that make Superman great, but these are the
          reasons that he wears the symbol of hope on his chest. He is an alien
          trying to fit in on Earth, he has enormous abilities that help him
          overcome great challenges, and he is still human. Superman still makes
          mistakes, he has weaknesses, and he struggles with many of the things
          you and I do every day.
