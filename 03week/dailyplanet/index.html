        <h3>Here's Why Superman Is The Ultimate Symbol For Hope</h3>

        <p>Superman is one of the most popular characters in pop culture;
        and ever since his debut on April 18, 1938, he has been inspiring
        readers, listeners, and viewers to reach for the sky. His character
        has given hope to many, and there are several reasons he can be
        considered the ultimate symbol for hope in fiction!

        <strong>His Heritage</strong><br>
        Unless you've lived under a rock all your life, you know that
        Superman is the Last Son of Krypton. He was raised on Earth, but
        is an alien by birth. This is one of the aspects that made his
        character so relatable then, and still resonates with fans today.
        How many of us have felt like outcasts, like we are alone in this
        world? These are issues that Superman stories have dealt with for
        generations. So many have read about the outcast from another
        planet with great abilities, who finds his place in the world, and
        they have escaped into those stories and been challenged to do the
        same themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>His Power</strong><br>
        Superman is known for his vast array of abilities. He has so many,
        I'm not sure I could begin to name all of them here. The abilities
        that seem to be his main power set are:
        <ul>
          <li>Super Strength</li>
          <li>Super Speed</li>
          <li>Flight</li>
          <li>Heat Vision</li>
          <li>X-Ray Vision</li>
          <li>Freeze Breath</li>
          <li>Invulnerability</li>
          <li>Accelerated Healing Factor</li>
        </ul>
        These abilities are given to Superman through absorbing the radiation
        of the yellow sun. Many have criticized him, saying that he is an
        overpowered superhero, but I argue that all these abilities are
        fundamental to his character. Superman instills hope because he is
        constantly faced with obstacles, and he somehow digs down and finds a
        way to overcome those challenges. Even in the New 52: Superman #38,
        Superman faced a new obstacle and developed a new ability: the super
        flare. This is why Superman wears the symbol for hope on his chest:
        He has an innate ability to overcome every obstacle he faces. We are
        able to look up to his character because he has all these incredible
        powers –– he could literally take whatever he wanted –– and yet he
        chooses to use these abilities for the benefit of others, not himself.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>His Humanity</strong><br>
        We look up to Superman because he is something of an outcast; we look
        up to him because he has an amazing ability to overcome the most
        daunting obstacles; and we look up to him because, despite all this,
        he still faces our everyday human struggles.This was a quality that
        was notably absent in the New 52 version of the character; it seemed
        that Superman was fine being the mega-powered individual that he was.
        Superman may have been born as Kal-El on a distant planet, but he was
        raised as Clark Kent by two down-to-earth, country folks. They
        instilled the moral and human qualities that make Superman a relatable
        character.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br>
        There are many things that make Superman great, but these are the
        reasons that he wears the symbol of hope on his chest. He is an alien
        trying to fit in on Earth, he has enormous abilities that help him
        overcome great challenges, and he is still human. Superman still makes
        mistakes, he has weaknesses, and he struggles with many of the things
        you and I do every day.
