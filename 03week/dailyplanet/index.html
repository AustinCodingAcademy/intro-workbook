        <strong>His Heritage</strong><br>
        Unless you've lived under a rock all your life, you know that
        Superman is the Last Son of Krypton. He was raised on Earth, but
        is an alien by birth. This is one of the aspects that made his
        character so relatable then, and still resonates with fans today.
        How many of us have felt like outcasts, like we are alone in this
        world? These are issues that Superman stories have dealt with for
        generations. So many have read about the outcast from another
        planet with great abilities, who finds his place in the world, and
        they have escaped into those stories and been challenged to do the
        same themselves.
