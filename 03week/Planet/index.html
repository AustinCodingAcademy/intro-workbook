         Have you ever wondered how long the world could withstand a zombie apocalypse? The University of Leicester has worked out that it would take only 100 days for the zombies to take over Planet Earth. Physics students from the university predicted a mere 300 humans would remain alive and uninfected at the end of the 100 days.They presented their findings in the Journal of Physics Special Topics, a peer-reviewed student journal run by the University’s Department of Physics and Astronomy.Using their hypothesis — that a zombie has a 90 per cent chance of turning a human into a zombie once it has found said human, and that a zombie could find at least one human a day — they predicted how long the population could hold out using the SIR model, an epidemiological model that describes the spread of a disease throughout a population. Using the model, they split the population into three categories; the susceptible population (S), zombie (Z) and dead (D).The lifespan of a zombie, they worked out, goes thus: S,Z,D. Natural birth and death rates did not feature in the working, as 100 days as the zombie epidemic took place over 100 days, which meant the natural births and deaths were negligible compared to the zombie virus.The model works out how much infected humans come into contact with non-infected humans, and how likely it is one will spread the disease to the other.Human survival rates were pitiful, with only a tiny amount of the population alive over the duration of the zombie apocalypse. In a more hopeful follow-up study, students worked out humans could prolong the survival of the species by killing off zombies and having babies in the nightmare scenario. They worked out that humans could become less likely to become infected by zombies over time as they became used to the risks and more able to deal with the monsters.The students worked out that under these conditions, it was feasible for the zombie virus to die off and humans to survive.Course tutor, Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer in the University of Leicester’s Department of Physics and Astronomy, said: “Every year we ask students to write short papers for the Journal of Physics Special Topics."It lets the students show off their creative side and apply some of physics they know to the weird, the wonderful, or the everyday.”</article>
