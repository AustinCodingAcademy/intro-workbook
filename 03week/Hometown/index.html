                  "I was an Insurance salesman with no college education for 3 years. Front-end Web development was not resembling the open door that 18-year old me thought would ever exist. I knew the insurance agency I was working for was not going to
                    be the place I wanted to be forever, and the chance to learn a valuable skill would need to be explored soon. At the end of 2016, I saw an open door emerge from a former roommate, who does web development. I could take 12 weeks to
                    figure out how to code and turn my new skill into something more than selling insurance policies.</p>

                <p>I picked up HTML and CSS3 however, found a battle in learning JavaScript/jQuery(Which was EXTREMELY worth it!), and met a great group of people in the tech industry. At the end of the program, I had a great body of work which fueled my
                    drive to begin our career in web development. </p>

                <p>
                    I am right now a front end developer for a startup company called "Extra Butter", a minimalist sneaker and clothing boutique. I'm utilizing JavaScript still, however there is a ton I'm learning in the terms of database related languages like SQL." </p>
