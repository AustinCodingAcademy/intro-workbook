            <b>WHAT KEEPS ME GOING: </b>Growing up in my culture, the expectation was as simple as growing up to be a loving wife/mother and because of that I was not given the opportunity to further my education. I'm proud of my upbringing, but I'm a sole believer of bettering myself in order to help others, be a better friend, sister, and wife. After tirelessly working full time trying to build my life, I've been given the privilege to attend the Java Script Full Stack Web Development program.
