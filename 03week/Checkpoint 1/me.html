        <p> Hello and welcome to my page. My name is TJ Bentley. I entered the world of photography on the other side of the lens, as a model. Over the last ten years as a model, my fascination for this art grew.  I decided to buy my first camera, and fell in love. Follow my journey of photography and allow the art to speak to you. </p>
