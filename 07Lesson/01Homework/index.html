            Kangaroos Are Adorable
          </h2>
          <p>
            The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning "large foot").
            In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family,
            especially those of the genus Macropus: the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo,
            and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that
            34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011,
            up from 25.1 million one year earlier.

            The domestic cat (Latin: Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal.
            Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.

          <p>
            Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong, flexible body,
            quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.

            Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed
            to the extinction of isolated island populations.

            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of
            dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.

            Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia.
            Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range.
