        A short history of bacon
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once upon time there were 3 Little Pigs. Their names were Ham, Bologne & Bacon. They were the best of friends, but they were not too smart. One day they left a candle on when they went to bed and their house caught on fire. The baby, Bacon, was burnt to a crisp. The end.
