    <h1>Hey, I'm Sean =)</h1>
    <p>Here's some things I care about and some things I do.</p>
    <p>Here's some job roles I have experience in, and the value I am confident
      I can bring to your company.</p>
    <p>This is my philosophy. I'll never say my job is limited to the hours or the tasks I was assigned, I'm here to give you what you need.  I work well with others and when I get home at night I want to feel like I brought value to the company. If I don't feel that way I will come and talk to you and we'll figure out how to fix that.  I'll go above and beyond my job description, and I won't come to you with problems, but with solutions.</p>
