            <h3>Lyft and Uber fulfill promise to leave Austin </h3><br>
            <p>Lyft has officially paused operations in Austin as of 5 a.m. Monday morning. Uber followed shortly after suspending service in Austin at 8 a.m. The decision for the ridesharing companies to bow out of the city comes after voters decided against Prop 1. The final numbers show 39,083 for Prop 1 and 49,158 against it. The proposition would have replaced the city’s ordinance requiring drivers to undergo mandatory fingerprint-based background checks.</p>

              <p>Uber and Lyft argue a mandatory fingerprint check is harmful to their business model, putting an unnecessary burden on drivers who already partake in criminal background checks. Uber said they will keep operating in Austin suburbs, but will not come into the city. Austinite Tim Hooper said there was one night when he was in law school “there were so few cabs. I remember we were trying to get a ride home and we were jumped by a group of guys who punched us in order to steal out cab because it was so hard to get a ride home.” While Uber and Lyft can’t pick-up rides that originate in Austin, they can still drop-off customers in Austin as long as the ride originates outside of Austin city limits. The same goes for Austin Bergstrom International Airport. For example, if you live in Round Rock and need a ride to ABIA, Uber and Lyft, will still pick you up and drop you off at ABIA. However, if you land at ABIA and need a ride, you’ll need to find another transportation option besides Uber and Lyft.
