<h3>Our philosophy</h3>
<p>We think that buying a vehicle should be a fun experience. We like to do business with good people. We have two locations to serve you and we look forward to the opportunity to do so.

We handle the latest Tesla model vehicles with an emphasis on environmental protection.

We provide local financing with your good credit at terms to fit your needs.</p>
<p>Tesla’s Model S is expensive (it ranges from $70,000 to over $100,000), but its range is 265 miles, more than triple that of Nissan’s Leaf (75 miles). Within a few years, Tesla hopes to produce much more affordable vehicles—including one that costs $30,000 to $35,000—with a range similar to that of the Model S. Tesla also wants to make electric cars more practical by building a nationwide network of charging stations that can deliver 200 miles of charge in about half an hour—compared to several hours to charge an electric car at an ordinary station today.</p>
