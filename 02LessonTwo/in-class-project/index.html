  <h1>SPECTER PROTECTOR</h1>
  <h2>Are you dead?</h2>
  <h3>When you lost your life, did you also lose your rights?</h3>
  <h4>Are you getting hounded by pesky ghostbusters?</h4>
  <hr>
  <h3>Let our talented team at SPECTER PROTECTOR ensure you get equal representation!</h3>
  <p>Just because you're a floating, gross mess of ectoplasm doesn't mean you're not a person. Ghost busters don't want you to know you're entitled to float about as long as you damn well please. They just want to get paid by the pesky lifers that don't like when you break their lamps. Stop the lifer oppresion! Know your rights!  </p>
  <p>We are the <strong>only</strong> ghost protection service on the market.</p>
