<h3> About Us </h3>
<p> All of the raw materials that go into making ceramics come from the earth, including the colors of glaze - this is a real testament to the quality of the product. While there have been successful methods to improve most products by substituting natural materials with synthetic, like vinyl and carpet, there are no such methods to improve the quality of the raw materials found in ceramics. They have changed very little over the past thousand years.
