    <p>Biographies are always weird because it feels like you're auditioning
    for something, no matter the reason why you write it. So you pick a bunch
    of things to appeal to this particular audience. For you guys, I'd
    probably pick something that highlights my tech background, because that
    reflects our commonality. So, I have always loved tech stuff. </p>
