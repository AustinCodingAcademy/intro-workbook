      <p>As I learn and share more about Web Development, I am coming across many people who do Web Development and Design. I recently had a conversation with an acquaintance where he asked me some questions to help me find my place in the world of Web Development.</p>

    <p>One question he asked was "Would you consider yourself as a creative type person or more mathematical?" I have always struggled with this question, because I believe that there is something more than just 1 or the other. My reply, "I consider myself to be both creative and mathematical. That's a hard question for me to answer, my background is both, and I am happiest when those worlds collide." I am happiest when I use my brain in a creative way, coming up with a solution is not always a mathematical process. Some of the best solutions are creative. I believe this takes a person who is both to their core. I want to create Web Applications not because I am creative, or because I am mathematical but because I am a perfect storm of both.</p>
