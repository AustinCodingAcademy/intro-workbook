    <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I grew up a military brat. My dad was an officer in
        the U.S. Air Force.  I had to move around to many different places.
        I had to say good-bye to many friends, but, luckily made new ones fast.
        As a kid, I didn't appreciate how fortunate I was to live in all these places.
        Many people don't even have a chance to leave their hometown.  I also think it has
        helped me to become a better person cause I'm good at change and adapting to new situations.
       I also can handle a wide range of personalitites.  It's amazing how the different people can be
     depending on what region of the country they are from. I'm glad I've had the opportunity to live in
   such a variety of places.</p>
