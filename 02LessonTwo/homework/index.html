    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Haley believes all successes in life come from the ability to have passion. People push her every day to become a stronger individual, and she pushes herself to make people see the world in more than just one way. She fully believes in the quote “the more you know, the more you know you don’t know,” and strives to gain more knowledge to build upon the wealth already retrieved. Haley uses her strengths and the strengths of others to solve problems and develop lasting solutions by still promoting a positive work environment.</p>
