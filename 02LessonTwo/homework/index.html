    <Section><h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I was once a <strong>little girl</strong>. Then I was a young woman. I was once a middle-aged woman, and I woke up one morning
          looking at 60. It's scary. But if you think of the alternative, that is, death, I guess it beats that. Why is this paragraph
          not wrapping? Do I need to insert a paragraph command? Let's see. Yes, I needed to insert a paragraph start and finish.
          I'm a bit confused as to what the point of a "section" is.</p>
