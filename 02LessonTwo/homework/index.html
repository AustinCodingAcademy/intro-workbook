		<h3>About</h3>

			<p>I am a musician and web developer currently residing in Austin, Texas.<br>

			I am an experienced electric and acoustic bassist, and played and recorded with well established artists throughout the South Eastern United States from 2005-2010.</p>

			<p>As an improviser, composer, and electronic music enthusiast, I use modern recording software like Ableton Live! to capture sequential chord progressions on piano and guitar and add drum parts in MIDI.</p>

			<p>When a composition is given form, I utlize my self created backing tracks as a solid canvas to paint  improvised musical ideas on bass guitar. (See Video Below).</p>

				I am also in the middle of what I hope is a 100 pound weight loss journey that began April 2015.<br>
				A little over a year ago I was sedentary, broke, hopeless and felt so uncomfortable physically that I didn't even want to leave the house.<br>
				Now I can't imagine life without my daily runs.<br><br>
				I am not fast.<br><br>
				But I do posesss an iron will and am determined never to let what I did to myself happen again.<br>

			<p>I am studying at Austin Coding Academy because I am sick and tired of dead end jobs that pay me just enough to get there and back</p>
			<p>I am studying at Austin Coding Academy to prove to myself that I can do this. </p>
			<p>I am studyiung at Austin Coding Acadmey because I am the one person who can truly change the course of my career. </p>
			<p>Instead of waiting for someoen to finally recognize, I've come to the realization that it's my like, my career, my future is my responsibility and if it's going to change it's going to be because of the work I put in and because I say a big F YOU to the fear that kept me from taking this class so manhy times before.</p>
