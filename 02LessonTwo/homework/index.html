    <p style="color:white">Right here and now, I do declare/this to be the new <span style="font-family:Impact">funky beat</span> of the year.

So now's the time, and this is the chance/cause the next record might not make you dance.

    <p>Listen to the bass drum hit the ground. The bass sounds like it weighs at least a pound. You heard the drum roll, there was a glare in your eye. But tell me the truth, are you that surprised? We make beats with rhythm and rhythm with beats; hear my records in the clubs, as well as the streets. So to all you emcees, that's looking for an idol, <span style="font-family:Impact">Jalil</span> is my name, <span style="font-family:Impact">Master Rapper's</span> my title.</p>

    <p>This beat here will be served and deserved. We'll rock on point, and turn all curves. We'll rock every beat with the greatest of ease, and if you try and drum roll us - we'll bob and weave. We'll slip and slurk, tear off our shirt, just to show you what it's like when a rapper's at work. So from now until the man who we feel/is gonna go rocking on the wheels of steel: <span style="font-family:Impact">Grandmaster Dee</span>, hit me!</p>

    <p style="color:white">Now you heard DJ's on the record scratch, but how many have you heard bust a rap? My DJ, <span style="font-family:Impact">Grandmaster Dee</span>, he raps on the mic with <span style="font-family:Impact">Ecstasy</span> and me. And when we're at the party, we turn it out, cause that's what Whodini is all about. I am the rapper that they call <span style="font-family:Impact">Jalil</span>. <span style="font-family:Impact">Master Dee</span> is the one on the wheels of steel. Behind the turntable, one and two. Something from <span style="font-family:Impact">Whodini</span>, special for you (yo), you (yo), you (yo), you (yo), you (yo), you, you, you, yo' <span style="font-family:Impact">Drew</span>!</p>

    <p>Yo last Fresh Fest I was rockin "Good Times". This Fresh Fest I'm busting out rhymes. When I'm on the set I take total control. I rock your mind, yo' feet, your body, your soul. Other DJs may stop and stare, but when I'm on the set, I show no fear. I rock the beat because it is bad. Jam the other the DJs know that I am def, def, def, def, yo <span style="font-family:Impact">Ex</span>! The point we tried to make, is simple. On the turntables he's quick and nimble. Since he's here we're gonna prove our point. Now that <span style="font-family:Impact">Whodini's</span> inside the joint. Born and raised in the streets of Brooklyn, there are three of us, and we're all good looking. Young ladies hearts, we're sho' to win. Cause like five plus five we equal ten. So easy on the tweeter, heavy on the bass; with some help from <span style="font-family:Impact">Master Dee</span> we're gonna rock</p>
