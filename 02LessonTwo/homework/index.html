  But stay tuned. In the meantime, here's some awesome
  stuff about me.
</P>

  <li>Travel</li>
  <li>Dogs</li>
  <li>Baseball</li>
</ul>
<h3>Favorite Websites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a huge fan of the Baltimore Orioles, so I like <tbody>
    check their scores and highlights daily. You can find the Orioles
    website <a href="http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bal">
    here.</a> Also, the Yankees suck!
  </li>
  <li>Here's a link to the facebook page for my acoustic duo,
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bubblesandbeersa/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">
    Bubbles and Beer. </a> We'll have a real website someday. Once I learn enough
    to build it.
  </li>
  <li>And <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">this one </a>. Because I like to buy all the things.</li>
</ul>

  but he thinks it doesn't count as long as his feet are on the floor. </p>
