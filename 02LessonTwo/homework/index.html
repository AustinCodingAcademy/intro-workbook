		<h3>About</h3>

			<p>I am a musician and web developer currently residing in Austin, Texas.<br>

			I am an experienced electric and acoustic bassist, and played and recorded with well established artists throughout the South Eastern United States from 2005-2010.</p>

			<p>As an improviser, composer, and electronic music enthusiast, I use modern recording software like Ableton Live! to capture sequential chord progressions on piano and guitar and add drum parts in MIDI.</p>

			<p>When a composition is given form, I utlize my self created backing tracks as a solid canvas to paint  improvised musical ideas on bass guitar. (See Video Below).</p>
