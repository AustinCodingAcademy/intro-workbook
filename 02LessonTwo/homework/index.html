  <h2>A little about me...</h2>
    <p class="text-paragraphs">
        I'm 2 months away from my 30th Birthday. I am originally from Texas; I've lived in Los Angeles, toured for half of my 20s, and i've been living in Austin since 2014. <span>Texas Forever!</span>I believe, like my Grandfather, that most concpiracy theroies are closer to the truth than most think. The media is bias duh! I have an 8 month old son named Graham. Being a father is the greatest time in my life so far. He is badass. He will travel the universe in search of new planets! We have a dog named Dali. She is a heeler/terrier mix that we rescued in San Marcos. She is such a good dog and though she is almost 7 years old, she is being very patient with the new guy in the house. I enjoy learning, being with my family, both eating out and cooking, and I love going to the greenbelt. I love music! I was in a band for about 11 years and my favorite part about that time in my life was creating music with people. This is my first time in school since I was 19 or 20. I am focused and excited to be learning a new skillset to build a career.
