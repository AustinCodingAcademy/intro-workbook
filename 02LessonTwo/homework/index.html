   <p>You've made it to my page. Congrats, that's dope. Now is the time where
      you get to know me a little better through words. Meghan is the name. I was
      born in Houston, Texas and moved to Austin in 2011 where I lived in a co-op for three years.
      I have two siblings including a twin brother named Drew. Marianna is
      my girlfriend, she amazes me everyday with her sassy charm and beautiful face.
      I see myself as a very easy going, laid back person and I love trying all
      the things such as exploring new foods and horizons, traveling to spontaneous
      places, joining a coding academy, turning my plates of food into casseroles
      and petting all dogs in sight. In five years I see myself living in New York
      City and pursuing a career in web development. No other subject has captivated
      me more and I plan to achieve all my goals that involve this topic. In the
      past several years I have learned that if you want something in life, you
      can have it. I've learned this from the situations I've been in, goals that
      I have conquered and even the women that I have dated. Mistakes have always
      taught me lessons and from that I have grown into the adult that I want to be.
      That's me.
