  <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in West Texas, Odessa to be exact. I went to Odessa Senior High School were I graduated in 2007. I tried the whole college thing right after, sadly I only attended for a semester and a half. Life happened and I was shoved directly into the workforce. I met a beautiful person 3 years ago who has pushed me to better myself. We decided that we wanted to make Austin our home. It's been a wonderful year of adventure living in Austin for us and I could'nt be any happier. I decided that I didn't want my life here in Austin to be the same as it was in Odessa. I want a sucessful career here, not just a job. My ultimate goal in life is to live a happy one and to create a loving family of my own.</p>
