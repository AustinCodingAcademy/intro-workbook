				<h2>About</h2>

        <p>I am a musician and web developer currently residing in Austin,
        Texas.<br>
        I am 35 years old.<br>
        I am an experienced electric and acoustic bassist, and am currently studying composition privately online with Tony Grey.<br></p>

        <p>As an improviser, composer, and electronic music enthusiast, I use
        modern recording software like Ableton Live! to capture sequential
        chord progressions on piano and guitar and add drum parts in MIDI.</p>


        <p>When a composition is given form, I utlize my self created backing
        tracks as a solid canvas to paint improvised musical ideas on bass
        guitar. In less pretentious words, I like to shred and I like to jam. (See Video Below).</p>

    <div class="journey">

				<h2>Health Journey</h2>

				<p>I am also in the middle of what I hope is a 100 pound weight loss journey
    		that started April 2015.<br>
    		I have lost almost 70 pounds and have accomplished something I once thought
    		was impossible.<br>

				A little over a year ago I was sedentary, broke, hopeless and felt so
    		uncomfortable physically that I didn't even want to leave my house.<br>

				A little over a year later I am active, broke, hopeful ,and feel strong, confident and grounded.<br>
    		After a humilating experience shopping for clothing for a job interview, I
    		decided I'd had enough.<br><br>

				Now I can't imagine life without my daily runs and then sense of
    		accomplishment I am able to self generate simply by walkng out the door and
    		moving my legs.<br>
    		This profound experinece has given me insight into the daily struggles many
    		people face when suffering from obesity.<br><br>

				I hope one day share my own story and inspire others to take the first steps of their own journeys.<br>
    		Continue scrolling to see before and after results so far.<br><br>

        <h2>Austin Coding Academy</h2>

      	<p>I am studying at Austin Coding Academy because I am sick and tired
        of dead end jobs that pay me just enough to get there and back.</p>

        <p>I am studying at Austin Coding Academy to prove to myself that I can
        do this.</p>

        <p>I am studying at Austin Coding Academy because I am the one person
        who can truly change the course of my life and career.</p>

        <p>Most importantly I am studying at Austin Coding Academy, because I have a insatiable hunger to understand more about the technology of the internet and how to use the web and beyond to contribute something good to this world.

				<p>I hope one day I can teach everything I have ever learned to everyone who ever wants to learn.</p>
