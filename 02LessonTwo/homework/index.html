            <h2>A little about me;</h2>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Austin, but grew up in San Antonio and New Orleans for my parents works. When they retired the first time we moved out to Lake Travis where I went to middle and high school. I went to college here in town and was a competitive swimmer
                for my first two years until I got a shoulder injury then I switched to Rowing and Water Polo. After college I coached swimming for about a year and half then joined the navy, I was in for about 4 Â½ years and spend most of it in Japan
                on a carrier. After the navy I moved back to Austin, discovered volleyball, started working in the legal field, and became involved with a non-profit.
