    <h2>Who I am:</h2>
      <p>
        I am an ambitious person with many facets in my life that make me who I am.  I have always been a great worker that has a proven track record in business.  For many years this is what defined me as a person.  In recent years I have discovered that balance is more important in my life and I am doing my best to find my balance.  To me balance constitutes four elements; <strong>work, family, exercise and FUN</strong>.  Until recently I leaned heavily in the work and I am very lean in the other three.  My current goal is to revise my life and balance my world better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a wonderful family with a son in his last semester in college and a wife that is an awrd winning playwright and poet.  These two are the reason I have always worked so hard, they are my center and my reason to live.  Now that school is coming to a close for my son and my wfe is getting more established time with them is become more of a reality and I want to spend time with them and have many years of cherished memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exercise is a way for me to reduce stress and live a longer life that will continue to have a quality of life so I can enjoy my family, have fun and continue to be productive in my work.  I enjoy most sports but I really enjoy walking.  My wife and I walk as often as we can and have a goal to walk daily.  Our typical walks are 5 miles long and are members of AVA which is a walking club.  Other than walking I like to swim and thoroughly enjoy SCUBA diving.  I am a certified diver and look forward to another opportunity to dive.  I like to play golf although it is difficult to call my version actual golf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun involves several things for me.  I enjoy traveling and I have been many places. There are numerous places that I still want to visit before I die.  Some of the places I have visited include; 45 of the 50 States in the United States, Russia, Japan, Samoa, Panama, Peru, Mexico, Canada, Dominican Republic, Belize, Ireland and most recently I was fortunate enough to be able to spend a week in Paris, France.  Other than traveling SCUBA diving is not only exercise but a lot of fun along with hiking and site seeing.  Being with my family is what I enjoy and being with them and enjoying life is the best of all worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned work is still important to me and being able to be a productive member of society is crucial.  I will still work for many years and all I ask from an employer is to be paid what I am worth.  Typically, most companies pay their employees the lowest wages they can get away with and still keep their employees. I have heard there are companies, however, who pay their employees what they are worth as an incentive to keep them. I have not yet found such a company but I am still hopeful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing let me say that I am a blessed person that has a loving family, good health and a job that currently pays my bills.  I am looking for that perfect company that will afford me the ability to have a balance and harmony in my life that I am looking for and allow me to travel more with my wife either for work or for pleaseure or both.
