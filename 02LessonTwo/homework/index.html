  <h1>Corbett Austin</h1>
  <h3>Political Master of None</h3>
  <p>I am a 25 year old whp has been working as an administrative aide for various politicians - both in Texas and Washington D.C. My last experience, which ended in December, left me utterly disappointed about the futile nature of the business, and the fate of the world in general. Ultimately, I've decided that working outside of politics would be the next best course of action. </p>
