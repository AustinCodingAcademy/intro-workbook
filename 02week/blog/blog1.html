    <h1>Hello!  My Name is Ty Sweet, and This is My First Blog Entry</h1>
    <p>Not quite sure what I should be writing about so I'm just going to fill it with random thoughts and maybe post some pictures as well, just to show that I can do that.  It would be nice to maybe type a couple of paragraphs worth of content so that I can practice doing different things with the layout.  I'm pretty sure I don't have that much to say though, so it will be interesting.  Especially if the resum&#233, bio and blog are all going to be tools for potential employment.  That means I will have to come back through and clean some things up.  Nobody wants to read random ramblings (alliteration!) of someone, especially if they really have nothing to say!</p>
    <p>So here it is, the second paragraph!  I'll probably wrap this up pretty quickly now, and I'm thinking that maybe each entry will deal with specific topics - just so I have something to write about.  I really don't want to have to write about nothing over the next several entriess, I'm afraid of what that would lead to!  I am really interested in how this is all going to come together though!</p>
