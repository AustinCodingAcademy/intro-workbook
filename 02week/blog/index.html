    <h1>Biblical Books Blog</h1>
      <h2> What's This Blog About?</h2>
        <p>For my whole adult life I have been interested in the study of the Bible.
           I am always on the lookout for books that can give me insight into its
           gems of wisdom and understanding. Nothing can replace reading the Word
           God itself, having said that, there is great benefit to reading the books
           of men who have dedicated their time and effort, even their lives to
           searching out the hidden treasure in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>I started this blog for other truth-seakers who are endeavouring to glean
           from the lessons that the bible has to offer in hopes that it will be
           usefull and beneficial in finding great books to read.
        </p>
        <p>If you have any questions about the books or the bible in general, feel
           free to email me. I may able to help direct you to a great resource.</p>
