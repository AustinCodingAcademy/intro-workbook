     <h1 class ="astronomy"> Astronomy</h1>
     <p>Planets - an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.
     <p>Stars - type of astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. </p>
     <h2> Geography </h2>
     <p> Continents - one of several very large landmasses of the world. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in area to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. </p>
     <p> Maps - a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.</p>
     <h3> Archaeology </h3>
     <p>Ethnology - is the branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different peoples and the relationships between them (cf. cultural, social, or sociocultural anthropology).</p>
     <p>Paleontology - the scientific study of life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the Holocene Epoch (roughly 11,700 years before present). It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms' evolution and interactions with each other and their environments (their paleoecology).</p>
