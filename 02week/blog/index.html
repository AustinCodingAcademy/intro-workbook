    <h1> DAY FIVE: NICE TO MEET YOU, WILSON </h1>
    <h2> <i>  The best volleyball I could ask for. </h2>
      <p> Well, it's been two days on this island. Today I stumbled across
        a packaged volleyball. I drew a face on it. I named it Wilson. </p>

      <h1> DAY FOUR: COLD, SCARED & LONELY </h1>
      <h2> <i>  I can't help but wonder if I'll ever see another face again... </h2>
        <p> You wouldn't expect a beautiful island like this to be so cold at night. <br>
        I keep wondering if anybody is out there looking for me. I keep hoping.</p>

        <h1> DAY THREE: CAUGHT A FISH TODAY </h1>
        <h2> <i>  I've never felt more primal. I wonder if anybody knows I'm even missing. </h2>
          <p> I've found that I act well under pressure. I have more raw instinct than I knew of. <br>
          Today, I went out and caught a fish with my bare hands. I'll never forget this day. </p>

          <h1> DAY TWO: FINDING FOOD</h1>
          <h2> <i> I'm real hungry. Maybe I could catch a fish...here goes nothing</h2>
            <p> It's only day two and I've been craving funions and coco-cola. I wonder if I can
            find some sort of tropical fish on the shoreline. </p>

            <h1> DAY ONE: CRASHED!</h1>
            <h2> <i> I think I'm the only survivor. </h2>
              <p> I went off to deliever these packages...the next moment we had crashed. I
              think I'm a lone survivor. Hopefully help comes soon.</p>
