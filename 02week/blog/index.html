  <h2>What is this Vegan Blog About?</h2>
  <p>I would like to bring awareness to those who are further interested in exploring veganism and doing something for yourself, the planet, and the animals. There are several documentaries that are available on Netflix that I highly recommend. I myself have been vegetarian since 16, never drank milk past childhood, and never ate eggs in my life due to my disdain for them. Being from Chicago I would eat an occasional piece of pizza, or cheese. I have since given that up due to some of the negative health implications that dairy products have on human health, the environment, and the extreme cruelty in the industry.</p>

  <p>For me it all started when I was 8 years old. A friend of my mothers came over with her daughter who was born the same day as I was, our mothers actually met in the hospital when giving birth. She was vegetarian and I wanted to be myself. My parents, specifically my father, objected proclaiming that I would eat whatever was put in front of me. End of story. That was that. It was always in the back of my mind until I was 16 and had a friend that became vegetarian, so I did as well. Then I went away to college where I majored in Animal Science, and I was tasked with a project from which we could select from a number of subjects. I selected Animal Rights and dove into as much material as I could find, joined the University's Animal Rights group, and participated in local events. I also made it my duty to interview and talk to many of my fellow students that had grown up on farms. I got so into the project and was shocked at some of the things I found, and even some of the mistreatment of animals even at the University level where I studied. I felt if a University dedicated to Animal Science saw fit to treat animals in that manner, I couldn't even imagine what happened on large factory farming operations.</p>

  <p>Many are just not aware, or chose to turn a blind eye towards the cruelty and negative health implications, and damage to the planet and our environment that the animal agriculture industry is responsible for. In this blog I will recommend/review a few documentaries that I recommend watching.</p>

  <h3>Cowspiracy</h3>
  <p>Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is a groundbreaking feature-length environmental documentary following intrepid filmmaker Kip Andersen as he uncovers the most destructive industry facing the planet today – and investigates why the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about it. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and pollution, is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry, and is a primary driver of rainforest destruction, species extinction, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, ocean “dead zones,” and virtually every other environmental ill. Yet it goes on, almost entirely unchallenged. With all the recent natural disasters and the changes in our environment and the planet earth, there are easy things we can do on a daily basis right at home starting with our choices on our dinner plate.</p>

  <h3>What the Health</h3>
  <p>What the Health is the groundbreaking follow-up film from the creators of the award-winning documentary Cowspiracy. The film exposes the collusion and corruption in government and big business that is costing us trillions of healthcare dollars, and keeping us sick. What The Health is a surprising, and at times hilarious, investigative documentary that will be an eye-opener for everyone concerned about our nation’s health and how big business influences it.I suggest watching this with the whole family, even the kids, as I believe at a young age, children should be aware of where their food comes from, what is in it, and what goes into getting it to the supermarket and on your plate.</p>

  <h3>EARTHLINGS</h3>
  <p>EARTHLINGS is a 2005 American documentary film about humankind's total dependence on animals for economic purposes.  Presented in five chapters (pets, food, clothing, entertainment and scientific research) the film is narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, featuring music by Moby, and was written, produced and directed by Shaun Monson. This documentary is a real eye opener, important to know that the images portrayed ARE NOT isolated images or footage, but disgustingly enough accepted industry standards.</p>

  <h3>The Cove</h3>
  <p>The Cove is an award winnng documentary about the yearly barbaric mass dolphin slaughter, and the cruel treatment of these highly intelligent mammals that are known to have protected humans from shark attacks. If you have ever swam with the dolphins, or visited an aquarium, you are sadly supporting this activity in Taji, as the best looking animals are taken captive to be sold off for profit. This is a must watch as we need to be more conscious of what we are supporting with our daily activities.</p>
  <h3>Forks over Knives</h3>
  <p>The feature film Forks Over Knives examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the degenerative diseases that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting animal-based and processed foods. This one is a must, as I firmly believe (and research proves) that most if not all of the top killers in the US are diet related, although unfortunately the focus in this country is on drugs (meds) or surgery. All the talk about the health care system when what we put in our mouths on a daily basis can be either the solution or our biggest problem. </p>
