    <p>Ethics experts have been pressing President Trump in the media for months. On Wednesday, they'll finally get their day in court. At the center of a federal lawsuit in New York is the U.S. Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause, which bars the president
      from accepting gifts from foreign governments without permission from Congress. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, will lay out its case before Judge George Daniels. Lawyers for the Justice Department have asked
      the judge to dismiss the case.</p>

    <p>The Han Solo "Star Wars" prequel film finally has a name, and the title is a little on the nose. "Solo: A Star Wars Story" is the aptly-named title of the upcoming origins story about Han Solo, the famous smuggler-turned-hero of the previous "Star
      Wars" films. "As we wrap up production I just want to take this moment to thank an incredibly talented cast and crew for all their hard work," director Ron Howard said in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday.</p>

    <p>The House ethics committee is investigating New York Rep. Chris Collins, the first Republican on Capitol Hill to endorse Donald Trump's presidential campaign, for potentially violating federal law and House rules regarding insider trading. The outside,
      non-partisan Office of Congressional Ethics began a review of Collins' activity in March and voted to send its findings to the House ethics panel in July, which can formally launch investigations and recommend any sanctions against any lawmaker
      it determines has broken any rules. The ethics committee announced in the release of the report that it would start a review of Collins.</p>

    <p>Yevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian oligarch dubbed "chef" to President Vladimir Putin by the Russian press. In 2002, he served caviar and truffles to President George W. Bush during a summit in St. Petersburg. Before that, he renovated a boat that became
      the city's most exclusive restaurant. But his business empire has expanded far beyond the kitchen. US investigators believe it was Prigozhin's company that financed a Russian "troll factory" that used social media to spread fake news during the
      2016 US presidential campaign, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. One part of the factory had a particularly intriguing name and mission: a "Department of Provocations" dedicated to sowing fake news and social divisions
      in the West, according to internal company documents obtained by CNN.</p>
