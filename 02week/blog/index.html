    <div>Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds. </div>
    <div>Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. </div>
    <div>What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you. </div>
    <div>General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. </div>
    <div>All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front! </div>
    <div>Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most... </div>
    <div>Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!</div>
    <div>Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation.</div>
    <div>Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.</div>
    <div>Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good. You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.</div>
