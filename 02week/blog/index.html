      <h2>Top 5 Choices for Study Spots</h2>
      <h3>Posted: April 20th 2017</h3>
      <p>I've decided to share with you my top 5 places that I like to go and study and/or read! All of which offer Wi-Fi because why would I list a place that didn't offer it!?
      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <div class="studylist">
        <li>Austin Hookah Lounge</li>
        <h4>Enjoy some hookah, coffee, or you can even BYOB if you like! Also, they allow outside food!</h4>
        <li>Bennu Coffee</li>
        <h4>A place that offers great coffee, pizza by the slice, and it's 24 hours! Good luck finding parking.</h4>
        <li>Epoch Coffee</li>
        <h4>Lots of seating here, very hip environment with great music on rotation. This place is also 24 hours.</h4>
        <li>Sa-Ten</li>
        <h4>This cute, asian-inspired place is located in the so-called "Gentrification" area of East Austin. Offers great food, great coffee, and even greater homemade lemonade. Here you can take a break and wander around at the art galleries and stores that neighbor this place.</h4>
        <li>Summer Moon Coffee</li>
        <h4>In my opinion, this place has the best latte's hands down with their famous 'Moon Milk'. </h4>
      </ul>
