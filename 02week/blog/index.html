          <h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.</li>
            <li>Be the change you wish to see in the world</li>
            <li>Today is a new day! You can start fresh, wipe the slate clean. Begin again!</li>
