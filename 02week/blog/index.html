<center><h1>Comedy Blog</h1></center>
<p>Question: What makes the world go 'round? Most people (like The Beatles and others) would say love. For me, I believe that laughter makes the world a better place (second only to love). This blog is about my favorite comedians and their rather comedic worldviews. Whether as a forward deployed soldier in Iraq or a father/ husband back home, laughter has helped me through more scrapes than I can count and is probably instrumental in helping me stay sane during tough times.</p>


<center><h2>Dave Chappelle</h2>
<p>During his invasion of Comedy Central with his hit TV show, Dave could bring laughter to anyone. Case in point: During my tour in Iraq, one of our interpreters stopped by my room within the FOB (Forward Operation Base) known as Camp Bucca which was located in southern Iraq. When he heard my laughter, he knocked on my door and I let him in. He asked me what was I looking at, and at the time I was looking at the episode with "Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Adventures" in which Dave played Rick James. My interpreter thought that this was really Rick James slapping Charlie. Needless to say, the interpreter added the well known catchphrase, "I'm Rick James, (insert profanity here)!" to his English and said this to an American nurse that he liked. Wrong move! When he told me what he did, I laughed hysterically as he had this nurse's handprint on his left cheek and summoned up the courage to ask me, "Jundi, do you think she likes me?" The lesson here is, "If you have a friend that wants to learn the proper way to speak to a woman, never ever let them quote any Chappelle lines."</p>

<center><h2>Gabriel "Fluffy" Iglesias  </h2>
<p>Clean and funny, "Fluffy" has always kept me in stiches with his impersonations. Reminescent of Eddie Murphy, his spot- on characterizations of his manager were, to me, some of his funniest material. As I previously mentioned, he is a very clean talent since most of his material does not have cursing. He does make up for it (if you like mature jokes) with innuendo. He has a way of telling a joke to an audience that makes you feel as if you were there when the situation happened.</p>

<center><h2>Eddie Murphy</h2>
<p>Often imitated and never duplicated, Eddie Murphy is one of the true legends of comedy. From his time on "Saturday Night Live' performing skits such as "Velvet Jones", "Mr.Robinson's Neighborhood" or the "James Brown Hottub", he was innovative and sharp. Two of his movies, "48 Hours" and "Boomerang" were easy for me to enjoy. But it was his filmed live performance entitled "Eddie Murphy: Raw" that sealed the deal.</p>
