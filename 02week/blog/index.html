        self proclaimmed shoegazer, I, matt guess, review my favorite (and pretty much whatever I get my hands on) guitar pedals, rack f/x, budget home
        studio recording equipment and techniques, floss digital vs. analog, spend way too much time discussing the art of compression and mastering, and
        share my lust for vintage jazzmasters and excessive reverb. I also play in raleigh shoegaze band white cascade and solo as jazz tapes

          Here we have a Ryu vs Ken moment. On one side we have the flaming multi-hit Shoryuken, and pretty boy looks matched with a rockstar arrogance
          that just jumps out of the screen and infects the player. On the other side we have a disciplined and focused lifetime warrior, complete with
          reverence, inner calmness, a more powerful hadouken and a tatsumaki-senpu kyaku that avoids projectiles. But pit the two against each other and
          time after time it is shown to be pretty much an even match.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, Instead of Capcom, we have MXR producing the characters: two high-quality and equally non-asian looking whippersnappers just waiting
          to jump into the fray and wrassle it out, and in this battle I have already selected my fighter–the MXR Custom Shop Custom Comp (In an actual SF
          match I would choose Ken of course). You will find out that like Ryu and Ken, deep down these two pedals have the same heart and soul.

          REV: LEX FIXED COMP

          In 2010, As Street Fighter II was approaching its 20th anniversary, pedal manufacturer MXR (or is it Jim Dunlop?) discovered a stash of legendary
          CA3080 “Metal Can” ICs, the principal component that provided the legendary tone of the original dyna comp. Being a fervent owner of the standard
          block M-102 Dyna Comp (it is the only pedal I keep on ALL the time, with low sensitivity and high output) I decided to follow this trend. The 00’s
          standard dynacomps are OK but not great compared to the original dynacomp, which sounded more open and less restricting. For $69.99 new, they are
          still a good deal, offering a much needed boost to the natural guitar harmonics and increased sustain with enough accompanying noise to make you
          consider getting a noise suppressor. They also choke your tone and give you too much squish if you max out the sensitivity. All in all, they don’t
          even touch the tone of the original. So, MXR decided to put their supply of NOS CA3080s to work and release a new reissue pedal true to the original
          1976 dynacomp specs and tone, completely handwired, and just like the original with no DC jack (battery only) or LED indicator, and of course the
          fancy script font. It retailed for $174 and like Ken there was a tradeoff for being the cool kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          People greeted the ‘76 RI with open arms and loved the tone and lower noise levels, and for the money many even preferred the '76 RI flavor to boutiques
          like the Keeley compressor. A lot of people were also sending their pedals to Analogman for his mod, which added true bypass, a DC jack, and an internal LED.
          Falling under the camp of modern conveniences I held out for the rumored 2nd edition of this pedal.
