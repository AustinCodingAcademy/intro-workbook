      <h1>Surving the Battle in a 4-3 Defense</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
<p> Hello! Welcome to my blog SURVING THE BATTLE IN A 4-3 DEFENSE. My name is Dwayne Missouri and I am a former athlete and coach of the
greatest sport on Earth...Football. I was blessed enough to have a 8 year professional playing career, including
the NFL and the Arena Football League. With my playing days behind me, I went on to a succesfull 8
year high school coaching career as a defensive coordinator, defensive line, and linebackers coach at various stops throughout
Texas. I decided to start this blog in response to the seeming belief that everyone has to run a 3-4 defense
today in order to counter the proliferation of the Spread offense in the High School ranks. I want you to understand
THAT IS NOT TRUE! By keeping your rules simple, your communication fluid, and your adjustments basic, you can line up
quickly and attack the offense in many different ways. At the end of the day, you're still playing with 11 men on the
field. It doesn't matter if 3 of them have hands in the dirt or 4 of them. It matters that all 11 understand their roles
and responsibilities within the defense you are running. So, run what you as a coach feel most comfortable with, but if
you are looking for some questions to be answered about the 4-3, or maybe just another perspective on different
options, WELCOME!

<h2>Aligment Variations</h2>
    <h3>OVER</h3>
  <img src="./css/BlogOverPic.jpg" alt="Over alignment for the 4-3 defense" style="width:500px;height:200px;">
  <p id="para1"> Depending on whether you feel the run will be your biggest threat or a quick passing game, you first need to decide
    how you want to align. Although TE's are not going to be seen every week, for the sake of this post, we will use
    a TE in the offensive set to delcare a strength. The "over" and "under" declaration is going to determin where
    your 3technique tackle will be placed. In ths example, we have a "strong left" given by the MIke LB, based on the TE.
    In an over alignment, this will place your 3 Tech on the side of the TE, generally with a 9 Tech DE as well. This will allow
    your LB's to be at a normal depth of 5 yards and in better position to play the pass drop off of their reads and keys. Away
    from the TE, you will place your 1 Tech nose tackle and 5 Tech DE. As stated before your LB's will be at 5
    yards depth. Generally a 50 for the Sam, weakside 10 for the Mike, and 40i for the Will. As a side note, if you are not sure
    of any of the terminology I'm using, please refer back to our terms and vocabulary page. The over alignment provides
    a good solid front seven alignment to stop the run and let your LB's play downhill within the box while also allowing
    them great vision into the backfield to scrape with option teams, get into their zone drops quicker with dropback
    teams, or get to the flat with teams that utilize a lot of swing passes to the back.

    <h3>UNDER</h3>
  <img src="./css/BlogUnderPic.jpg" alt="Under alignment for the 4-3 defense" style="width:500px;height:200px;">
    <p id="para2">The under alignment will place your 3 Tech DT to the "open" side, or away from the TE. This alignment will
    be for a slightly more stout run defense, in particular for an offense who want to pick on your Will with a lot
  of weak side run. In a passing situation, you can widen your DE out a bit, allowing him to pull the OT out on an island
insuring you will get a one on one pass rush with your 3 Tech against the guard. To the TE side, you will have your Nose
in a 1 Tech, DE in a 5 tech, and your Sam backer will be screwed down on the LOS into a 9 Tech with eyes on the TE
for his initial read. Due to the fact you have covered the weakside B gap with your DT, you can adjust the alignment
of your Lb's to reflect this. Your will can slide down to a weak 30 and your Mike will bump to a strong 30. The true
run stopping advantage to this alignment is that you can get an immediate 8 man box by bringing your Strong Safety down
to LB depth and playing him there. Since the Sam is getting hands on the TE, a fast release should not be an issue. </p>
<h2>Simplicity of Quarters</h2>
    <p id="para3">
    Playing quarters allows us to line up simple, in the same 2 High safety look and play dominant coverage with automatic
  run support built in to any offensive formation we get. By keeping our rules simple and commuincation clear concise and
effective, every single play we will have force, alley, and cutback players defined. With every formation, our secondary
will know if they are pass first or run first. We will start with a Pro alignment with TE and Wr to one side. Our corner
will align at 7 yards depth. We prefer inside alignment to try and take away the easiest throw, which is the slant. You can
also align with an outside force and Rob with your safety. Our corners are told they may not get help from the Safety
at all, so they are expecting to not help in the run game at all. Over the TE, Safety will align at 8 yeards with outside force
. Safety is primary force with no wide #2. If Te goes vertical, safety is responsible. If he runs anything under the LB's
he will then look to help out with the WR. With 2 Wr's the Safeties responsibility changes to pass first. The LB will walk
to an apex position of #2 and EMOLOS and he is now responsible for Force. Safety will back up to 10 yards and take an inside
alignment again, trying to take away the post, as the LB should help discourage the slant. In any case, we feel we can get by
with having our safeties eyes ALWAYS read #2 for his inital read. No matter what the formation, besides goalline, we feel this puts
puts him a great place to get a fast and accurate read. We will discuss this kore in a later post.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Trips</h2>
    <p id="para4">One of the biggest issues that teams have in the secondary on a 4-3 defense, is with Trips. The stress
    of 3 Wr's to one side can put your weak safety in a jam. Ideally, you would be able to get a personnel package
  on the offense and match up accordingly with your own personnel package. However, we know that rarely happens
now a days with up tempo, no huddle, and such and such. I believe that you can still be solid on both the run and the pass
again, based on simple rules, clear concise and effective communication, and everyone knowing their rules. This starts
with your Strong Safety recognizing he has 3 WR's to his side and communicating "TRIPS" to the defense. This in turn will
do a few things. The first, is that it will pull the Sam out of the box and make him a primary Pass first player. We like
to put him head up to slightly inside the number 2 receiver to combat any down block by him, and give him a fighting
chance to get over the top of that. He will have eyes on number 3. If he takes a lateral step, the Sam will then fight tooth
and nail, to get over the top of the down block and attack the screen pass. If number 3 goes vertical, Sam will get into
his normal Curl/Flat drop. "Trips" will also alert the Mike he has to do a couple things. He will "slide" the strength
of the D-Line, putting an open B gap to the Trips and closing the backside B gap. This will allow him time to help
on a hot route to the number 3 receiver, while not being stressed to plug an open A gap to his side. He can walk to a strong 50
and with good eyes on his keys, get a great read for the hot, or the run to his B gap. Will, will then adjust as well, moving to a weak
a weak 10, ready to plug an open weak A gap. The true stress will be encountered by the FS. Through our personnel discussion
earlier, this needs to be a guy that can cover some ground quickly. He will be at 8 yards depth on a 45 degree tilt to the QB. On the snap
he will shuffle two steps backwards with eyes on the Qb. If he gets run read, he simply plants and comes downhill on that
same 45 degree path to interscept the runner. If he gets pass, he continues on his original path and plays, 3, 2, to 1.
Remember, Mike is holding off any hot throw and the FS has to trust this so as not to get anxious. 3 is not a threat to him for at least ten yards</p>
