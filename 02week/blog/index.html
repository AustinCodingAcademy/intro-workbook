    <h2><b>Hunting</b></h2>
<p><b>Growing up as a young man, I was introduced to hunting by my father.  I grew up primarily hunting for deer, although I did do an occasional hunt for predators, such as Coyotes, Bobcats, and  Racoons. I remember as a very young adult, I was coming down the road and noticed a line of cars parked on the side of the road, everyone was in amazement at what they were seeing.  I was at the time for me, the only Hog I had ever seen, but also still one of the biggest ones.  This is where my facination with Hogs came to life.</b></p>

<p><b>Once I started going out hunting on my own, it seemed like I all I ever did was pursue the Hog, looking for the one BIGGER than the next. My biggest Hog to date is 428lbs, more than twice my size. Hogs are sometimes very easy to hunt and sometimes very hard to hunt.  It just depends on which method you use. </b></p>


<h1>Rifle/Gun Hunting</h1>
<p><b>Rifle hunting is probably the most successful and easiest ways to hunt Hogs. The easiest type of hunting we did was blind hunting with a rifle. This type of hunting consisted of sitting in an elevated stand, mostly some type of box blind or an elevated tree stand.  These types of stands could be anywhere from twenty-five yards to a hundred or more yards away and this made the success rate much greater. Growing up with my dad, this was the only method I knew, so becoming an expert shot came easy and made for a succesful hunt most of the time.  Practice though was still a mandatory thing at our ranch.  We always had to be sure that our rifle and our sights were dead on so as not to injure an animal. </b></p>
<h1>Knife/Dog Hunting</h1>
<p><b> Knife and Dog hunting for Hogs, for me has got to be one of the most dangerous and scariest ways to hunt Hogs.  You have to get up close and personal with them and if youre scared, this is not the way you want to hunt them.  Although the dogs do mot of the work for you, you still have to come up and grab the hind legs and hold it down with your knee to either stick it with a knife or tie it up (hog tie it). This can be very dangerous and even more dangerous as you get into bigger hogs.  The Boars have tusk that can be up to four inches long and even a bit longer, sharp as a knife and can cut you in an instant.</b></p>
<h1>Archery Hunting</h1>
<p><b>This is the hardest of all they tpes of hunting.  With Archery hunting you are not as up close and personal as you are with the dogs, but you are very close, close enough for them to see and smell you and this alone makes for unsuccesfull hunts most of the time.  Whwn it comes to Archery hunting, and harvest(kill) is a trophy because it is so difficult to get off a shot without being detected.</b></p>
