                <span class="animate">W</span>omen and children flee the scene as the monsterous rodents ransack food trucks on East 7th Street. John Mightylips saw the choas first hand: "I just finished paying a sum equal to my car payment for three apples and a bottle of 'ionized' water at Whole Foods.

He fixes his gaze downward, rubbing the creases between his eyebrows, then slowly stroking his silver beard. Gandalf removes his seasoned wizard hat and points at the crosswalk. Dozens of humans, orcs, forsaken ones, and mimics pay no attention to the crosswalk sign's blinking red hand. "This generation pays no heed to the ancient law of man," Gandalfs contiues.
