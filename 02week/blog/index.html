        <p>Today in class I learned what HTML Semantic Elements are. I learned that HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Langauge" and it's a standard mark up language for creating web pages and applications. I was able to create my first html website by typing, "Hello, World!". I also learned how to link specific images or websites to my html and also changing the background image or color. I've also learned the importance of creating a structure of a webpage and how it's established. From there, I was able to create my first own website using information from my resume! After that, we began learning on how to use git and understand what git is. We learned how to commit, push, and pull using the github web portal. I'll be honest, I'm still having trouble understanding on the whole process, but from talking to others, seems like I will have to keep practicing and I'll eventually understand on how to use git functionally!</p>

        <p>In class, we started getting into CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS basically provides the styling for a webpage. From here, I learned how to apply text appearance, font, alignment, spacing, and indentation. Our class project for this week was to create a bio page and a blog page. I also learned what CSS Selectors are and what it can do to change the look of our HTML page by using CSS.</p>
