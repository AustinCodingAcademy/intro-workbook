<h1><center>Influential Video Games</center></h1>

<h2><center>Influence on Gaming Culture</center></h2>

<p>As an avid fan of video games from a young age i would like to go back and take a look at some of the games that shaped the industry to this day. Games have always been a big part of my life and shape the way i think about things and the world. Just as games have shaped my life these games have shaped the industry.

<h2>Mortal Kombat</h2>
Mortal Kombat is resposible for single handedly bringing forth the ESRB rating system. Being rather gruesome for a game produced in 1992, it is responsible for the now universal rating system after major out cry from parents across the globe.

<h2>Wolfenstein 3D</h2>
Wolfenstein 3D is the first real FPS (first-person-shooter) that came out in 1992. It laid the ground work of all FPS games for decades to come. The "3D" part of the game was a new technology that used perspective and layers of the game that gave it a fake effect of 3D that isnt actually real.

<h2>Pong</h2>
Pong is widely credited with being the first video game made, and they wouldnt be wrong. It is the first self contained game that didn't require any outside equipment to play (there is a game on the magnavox odessey that uses physical plastic game sheets). Pong was a popular arcade game that first made its way into homes on the Magnavox Odessey, the first home gaming console. Pong was the game that started the arcade boom of the 70's and on.
