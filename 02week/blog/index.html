    <h1>Biblical Books Blog</h1>
      <h2> What's This Blog About?</h2>
        <p>For my whole adult life I have been interested in the study of the Bible.
           I am always on the lookout for books that can give me insight into its
           gems of wisdom and understanding. Nothing can replace reading the Word
           God itself, having said that, there is great benefit to reading the books
           of men who have dedicated their time and effort, even their lives to
           searching out the hidden treasure in the Bible.<br>


           <span class="indent">I started this blog for other truth-seakers who are endeavouring to glean
           from the lessons</span> that the bible has to offer in hopes that it will be
           usefull and beneficial in finding great books to read.<br>

           <span class="indent">If you have any questions about the books or the bible in general, feel
           free to<a href="mailto:titusironsides@gmail.com">email</a>me.
           I may able to help direct you to a great resource.</span>

        <h2><span class="booktitle">Justification: God's Plan, Paul's Vision</span> by N.T. Wright</h2>
          <p>This is the most exiting book I have ever read on the topic of Justification.
             It is was hard to set down once I started to read it. N.T. Wright expertly shows that
             Justification has its roots in the Old Testament and that it is just one part of a larger
             whole of what makes up salvation in the Bible. More specifically it is about the covenant
             that YHWH made with Abraham. It is a must read for all those about to journey on the road
             of justification.</p>

        <h2><span class="booktitle">The Art of Reading Scripture</span>
                                    by Ellen Davis and Richard Hays</h2>
          <p>Many times when the thought of Biblical study arises, one is automatically thrust into
             a technical endeavor. This book proved to me over and over that the artistic side of Biblical
             exegesis is just as vital to the understanding of God's Word as the technical. Highly
             recomended!</p>

        <h2><span class="booktitle">Paul and The Faithfulness of God</span> by N.T. Wright</h2>
          <p>To say that this book is a game-changer would be an understatement! He integrates historical,
             literary, philosophical and theological approaches to the Bible superbly. He explores Pauls
             extraordinary achievement of unveiling Judaism around a crucified and risen Messiah. Each
             chapter reveals something profound about the faithfulness of God freshly revealed in our
             Messiah and conveyed to us by the Spirit. This is a must read!</p>
