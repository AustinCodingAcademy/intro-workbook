        <h2>The Best Way to Make Cold Brew Coffee Is Also the Handsomest</h2>
        <h3>The thing contains the entire cold brew-brewing process inside itself, which means all you need to do is dump some grounds into the little insert, fill the jug with water, and let it sit for a day. When you remove the insert, bang it around the rim of your trash can until all the wet coffee ground guts fall out, rinse it in the sink, and set it aside for the next time you use it.</h3>

      <h2>How to Turn Your Cold Brew Coffee into a Cocktail</h2>
      <h3>Mezcal is tequila’s bolder, smokier cousin—and it plays great with bitter cold brew. Laman likes to amp up the bitter by using a chicory-laced cold brew for her mezcal drinks. (For the uninitiated: chicory is a bitter root often brewed with coffee, particularly in New Orleans). To turn the whole thing into one “damn fine coffee cocktail,” she sweetens it up with horchata, Mexico’s famed sweet, cinnamony, rice-and-nut based drink that you can probably buy at your local fancy grocery store.</h3>

      <h2>Japan's latest coffee craze will make you forget all about the Unicorn Frappucino</h2>
      <h3>Yes, it is what it sounds like — the sweet caffeinated elixir that helps us go, coffee, lovingly poured into a wide array of ice cream cones. It's both brilliant and potentially sinfully addictive. A quick search of Instagram reveals that there are a number of cafes around the world offering this delicacy as an option, but leave it to Japan's foodies to dedicate an entire business to the innovative treat. Tokyo-based café Coffee Cone not only serves coffee in cones covered in various treats (chocolate, sprinkles, etc.), they also add a little latte art to the surface of each drink, making it nearly impossible not to photograph anything you buy there.</h3>

      <h2>New Starbucks in Brooklyn ignites fear that java joint will hurt local coffee shops</h2>
      <h3>Wake up and smell the competition. That was the reaction of some local residents and small business owners to the new Starbucks opening next spring in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. While elected leaders were touting the arrival of the big corporate coffee machine to the corner of Broadway and Marcus Garvey Blvd., some java drinkers were percolating about the new proprietors. "It's kind of a waste," said Maritza Colon, 32, a Parks Department employee. "Another coffee shop? Really? If they're trying to help the community that would be good. There are a lot of new faces around here. It's like they're trying to turn Brooklyn into the new Manhattan." Matt Staples, 26, who runs The West, a Williamsburg coffee shop, said the idea of another Starbucks left a bitter taste in his mouth. "I think it's horrible,” Staples said. “It’s awful competition for local coffee places. They're going to undercut all the costs. And their coffee is burnt and terrible. "If it were a mom and pop place I wouldn't be mad.”</h3>
