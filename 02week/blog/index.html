          Sun Chemical is now deploying onsite and offsite renewable energy programs as a way to cut electricity costs and to improve environmental performance. Its latest effort is the installation of rooftop and carport solar panels, all under a contract to buy the output at a fixed cost to serve one of its production facilities in New Jersey — a deal that it says has saved it $400,000.

          <p class="paragraph">Rich in history and culture and with a powerful economy and military, China is seen by many as the emerging global superpower.When it comes to renewable energy, China is, in many ways, striking out on its own. According to the International Energy Agency, new solar photovoltaic capacity grew by 50 percent in 2016. China alone accounted for nearly half that expansion. In the wind energy sector, China installed a staggering 23.4 gigawatts of new capacity in 2016, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.
