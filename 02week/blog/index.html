      <p class="teaser">I made a book that explains things. It’s called Thing Explainer. It will be out soon! It’s a big flat book full of pictures of things with lots of parts. There are also little words that tell you what all the parts do. You can read more about it
        here!</p>

      <p class="teaser">Back in early March, I posted comic #1337, Hack, about a wayward spacecraft. ISEE-3/ICE was returning to fly past Earth after many decades of wandering through space. It was still operational, and could potentially be sent on a new mission, but
        NASA no longer had the equipment to talk to it—and announced that reconstructing the equipment would be too difficult and expensive.</p>

      <p class="teaser">The OKCupid statistics blog, by Christian Rudder, is amazing. Sadly, it hasn’t updated since 2011, around when OKCupid was bought by Match.com. (Rudder says the timing was a coincidence—he took time off for another project, and the blog may return
        soon!)</p>

      <p class="teaser">I don’t like large numbers without context. Phrases like &ldquo;they called for a $21 billion budget cut&rdquo; or &ldquo;the probe will travel 60 billion miles&rdquo; or &ldquo;a 150,000-ton ship ran aground&rdquo; don’t mean very much to me on
        their own. Is that a large ship? Does 60 billion miles take you outside the Solar System? How much is $21 billion compared to the overall budget? (That last question is why I made my money chart.)</p>
