  <center><h1>Jackie's Photography Rants</h1></center>

<p>This blog will be used to rant about the types of photography that I have used in my time as a student and  a professional. I will be covering formats that I shot regularly or have just played with for fun. Talking about current trends and topics in the photo world.</p>

 <h3 class="pop"><u>Shooting Film</u></h3>

<p class="ex1">I think that shooting film is somthing that is really making a come back. Because digital is so "easy" meaning you can just keep shooting until you get what you like, or can make chanages to images in post production. Shooting film is not only pricey but you actually have to understand your tool and light. Shooting film can be some what of a gamble, you cannot access that image until after development. Hoping you captured the image you set up for. I think the appeal of this suprise is making a comeback, people are looking for a challenge again. A more hands on process, with more steps involved can make you appreciate the image so much more. Lets not forget the image quality is different, it has a personality. You can't recreate the quality of film, its grainy and color depth is something you just cannot get form buying a filter.....</p>

  <h3 class="pop"><u>Medium and Large Format</u></h3>
<p class="ex1">Just like getting a digital camera with more megapixels, so that you have the options like better quality for enlargments. When you are shooting film and venture into the world of medium and large format you get to have the option of having a bigger negative that allows you to make a bigger print. But this is just a small positive note, we get into playing with different cameras that can give you some of the best quality images. My favotite camera to shoot film with is my Hasselblad, my beautiful german square format cadillac of a camera. The quality is just so buttery and rich, it doesnt compare to my digital images. My 4x5 camera has a life of its own, large format makes you slow down and consider each step you are making. Also the price of film and proccessing are going up as the format, so slow down and make sure everything is right!</p>

  <h3 class="pop"><u>Tin Types</u></h3>
<p class="ex1">Tin Types is a whole other monster! It's all about the process for this one, and not you are playing iwth chemistry. Stinky chemistry at that. Patience is very important here, I have only played with dry plate tin types which is "easier" then wetplate. Fewer steps involved with dry plate, if you have ever used liquid light then this may be a familiar process. You will need a dark room though, you have to coat your tin plates in a dark room with a red light. You have to then let the pates dry before exposing and then you will have to come back to you dark room for processing. When shooting your plates the light sensitivity of the liquid light is super low so expect a long exposure time and for you subject to be still! when it all aligns and you develop your plate...... its magical! There is no other look and feel like a tintype, its a piece of history that will last years! Enjoy!</p>
