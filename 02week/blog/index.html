Ryan Gosling seriously redeemed himself. He managed to have enough creepy cool that he was able to shake off any charming softie stigma he may have garnered from his previous romance/drama works. Now I trust he'll do well in the upcoming BLADE RUNNER sequel. Back to this one, the directing was really top notch too! Though, I could of contributed some fantastic 80's revival synth wave.. If only they would've asked me! :P </div>
