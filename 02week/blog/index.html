    <h3>Kristian's Top Three VR Experiences for the Newbie</h3>
    <p>So you’ve jumped head first into VR, bought your Oculus Rift or HTC Vive headset and confirmed your computer has the muscle and resolve to deliver an exceptional, life-changing experience.  Now what?  Which games and experiences should you try first?  Fear Not! I have the answer.</p>
    <p>I have come up with a short list of three must-have experiences for the VR Newb.  Below is a quick summary taken from the developer's website and my own personal commentary of my experience with each.  I hope each takes your breath away and maybe buckle your knees with the belief of “I’m really in a different World”.</p>

        <p class="para1">theBlu: is a deeply immersive VR series that allows audiences to experience the wonder and majesty of the ocean through different habitats and come face to face with some of the most awe inspiring species on the planet. The series, which is directed by Jake Rowell (Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Superman Returns), has been designed as beautiful moments in passing or a collection of memories that powerfully tap into the vast potential of VR. The debut episode, featuring an incredible close encounter with an 80 foot whale, is already recognized as one the most iconic room scale VR experiences to date (a Sundance Film Festival 2016 selection). Additional episodes in this bundle take place on a teeming coral reef and in the very deepest region of the ocean. Gain access to new modes of discovery in each episode. Slow time and capture pictures in Inspector Mode, and return to a meditative version of each location in Ambient Mode. <i>- from the developer</i></p>

        <p>theBlu is a must for anyone new to VR, either for yourself or if your showing a group of friends VR for the first time.  There are three episodes from which you can choose.  Each gives a slightly different experience but all center around being submerged in the ocean.  I think most of us at one time or another wished we could live under the water and swim with the fish without having to breathe.  theBlu let's you do just that.  My personal "awe" moment was seeing fish swimming near and around so close that you can literally reach out and interact just like you could if you were really diving with gear.</p>

        <p class="para1">Richie’s Plank Experience will test your fear of heights. Take an elevator to the plank that sits on a building 80 stories high, then dare to walk to the end! When you use a real plank of wood, the easy setup will add it into VR with accurate size, height, and location. Three bonus levels include a flying fireman experience and a sky-writing simulator. <i>- from the developer</i></p>

        <p>If you don’t believe that VR can make your body have a physical reaction to virtual stimuli, then I invite you to try Richie’s Plank Experience.  One word of caution, if you are afraid of heights then please make sure your play area is safe.  This experience will show you that a fooled brain can radically affect your body.  I don’t want to spoil anything but if you’re brave enough, then step off the plank!!</p>

        <p class="para1">Gnomes & Goblins is an original production from Wevr (creators of theBlu) in partnership with Reality One that offers a unique opportunity to explore an enchanted VR world created by Jon Favreau (director of The Jungle Book, Chef, Iron Man). In this preview, you meet and develop a personal relationship with an enigmatic resident of this interactive fantasy, taking a first step into the lucid dream of Gnomes & Goblins and its many realms and denizens.<br><i>- from the developer</i></p>
        <p>Gnomes and Goblins is the type of VR experience which you just don't want to end.  You'd be perfectly fine staying in this fantasy environment forever.  You can feel that a special story needs to be told about the inhabitants of this magical place.  You must explore and believe that your companion is alive and needs a little bit of help.  And for that help you will be rewarded.</p>
