            <p>Don't wait for the rental... enjoy this one in theaters, where
            the threat creeps offscreen to lie in wait for you and the rest of
            the audience.</p>

        <p>It's only January, but 'Mom and Dad' is already a contender for the worst
          movie of 2018.</p>

        <p>Elias' second feature intrigues and sets a mood, but like a lot of recent
          'arthouse on a budget,' it leaves a bit too much unsaid.</p>

          <p>We've seen this sort of suburban crime story dozens of times before, but
            'Midnighters' mines depths and unearths revelations from the leanest of
            dialogue.

          <p>Come for the countless, classic one-liners ("We've gone on holiday by
            mistake!"), stay for the bravura performances by Richard E. Grant and
          Richard Griffiths.</p>

          <p>Forman made at least two (count'em) of the Great Films of the 20th
          century, the justly-lauded "Amadeus" and the lesser-known "Firemen's
          Ball." And there's more than a few fans who'd rank "Hair," "Loves of
          a Blonde" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" right up there too.</p>
