  <h1>4 Creative In-Camera Transitions You've Got to Try</h1>
  <h4>01.23.2018</h4>
  <p>Wipes, fades, and traditional cuts serve an important purpose in filmmaking, but every now and again it's nice to add a little flavor to your work with a stylized transition. You can do some crazy stuff in post, but if you want to save time and do it
    all in-camera, then you'll want to check out this video by Darious Britt of D4Darious. In it he shows you how to pull off four dope in-camera transitions that you can do 100% handheld, no stabilizers or special camera gear required (unless you feel
    so inclined).</p>
  <p>Back in November, Britt shared a video that showed you how to do six other in-camera transitions, but you know what? Six just isn't enough, you guys! These stylish in-camera transitions aren't just good to know because they're en vogue right now, they
    actually demonstrate the technique of hiding edits within motion blur, something many Hollywood and professional filmmakers use in their work (like Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Chivo Lubezki in Birdman).</p>
  <h1>Good Things Come in Small Packages: DJI Releases Foldable, Portable Mavic Air Drone</h1>
  <h4>01.22.2018</h4>
  <p>DJI has created a brand new class of drone.</p>
  <p>It seems, lately, DJI is trending downward in size but not quality. Over the past 18 months, the company has iterated its technology and released new products at an incredibly rapid pace. It began with its release of the Mavic Pro about a year and a
    half ago, making it easy for people to bring a 4K drone with them wherever they go, thanks to its foldable design and small chassis. After that, DJI debuted the Phantom 4 Pro, which boasts advanced obstacle avoidance sensors and professional quality
    imaging and is designed for creative professionals. Since then, DJI has released its smallest drone, the Spark, which features gesture control, and can automatically take complex shots at the tap of a button; the world’s first 6K Super 35mm drone-optimized
    cinema camera, the Zenmuse X7; and today, No Film School was in attendance when DJI released its most portable 4K drone to date, the Mavic Air.</p>
  <p>About the half the size of the Mavic Pro, the Mavic Air also features twice the resolution of the Spark, allowing it to slot in very nicely between the two ultra-portable models. But the Mavic Air’s size is only part of the story. DJI’s latest creation
    also has some new and improved features designed to redesign on-the-fly creativity.</p>
  <h1>'The Alienist': DP P.J. Dillon on Creating a 'Visceral Connection' to 19th Century Murder Mystery</h1>
  <h4>01.20.2018</h4>
  <p>Though set in nineteenth century New York, and steeped in the heady, sprawling, excessive atmosphere of that time, the images at the heart of the TNT limited series The Alienist have a piercing, shocking clarity to them that transcends period. One of
    the very first of these is an eyeless child's corpse, a crucial element of the procedural to follow. As the camera moves in, we stare more deeply at the haunting, blank face, and everything around it, teeming and surging as the backdrop might be,
    falls away.</p>
  <p>The story takes place in the infancy of psychiatry, tracking Dr. Laszlo Kreizler (Daniel Bruhl), an early forensic psychiatrist, or "alienist," New York Times artist George Moore (Luke Evans), and Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning), a secretary for the NYPD,
    as they search for the person behind a string of murders of male child prostitutes. No Film School touched base with The Alienist series DP P.J. Dillon, who has previously worked on Penny Dreadful and Game of Thrones, to learn about the work that
    went into creating this series' taut and disorienting cinematography.</p>
  <h1>BET Wants to Buy Your Script and Make Your Film Through Project CRE8</h1>
  <h4>01.19.2018</h4>
  <p>Have you always dreamed of selling your script and seeing your film be brought to life? Well, BET wants to do just that.</p>
  <p>Yesterday at the Sundance Film Festival, BET announced that submissions are now open for Project CRE8, its nationwide screenwriting competition that aims to give up and coming screenwriters and filmmakers a chance to not only win some money and have
    their films produced but to also show the world what it's like to make a film as a first-timer through an hour-long documentary special on BET. The winning screenplay of Project CRE8 will be purchased for $55,000 and made into a feature film.</p>
  <p>In Round 1 of Project CRE8, each contestant's script will be read by a panel of judges who will narrow the pool down to the Top 50 finalists. In Round 2, the Top 10 will be named by both BET and Paramount Players executives. Each of the 10 finalists
    will be given $2,500 and a month to create a 2-3 minute scene from their script. In Round 3, these scenes will be posted on BET.com for the public to vote for their favorite, which will determine one of the Top 5 finalists, while judges will name
    the other four. The Final Round will see the Top 5 finalists pitch their films to multiple panels of successful filmmakers, writers, and executives and in the Summer of 2018, a winner will be announced.</p>
  <h1>3 Tips on Shooting More Cinematic Drone Footage</h1>
  <h4>01.18.2018</h4>
  <p>Shooting from the sky? Here's how to make your shots more cinematic.</p>
  <p>If you're flying a drone, you've already got one of the best vantage points a low-budget filmmaker can have (and one that wasn't within our price point until a few years ago), but how do you take advantage of this unique perspective to capture some
    beautiful, cinematic shots from the sky? In this video, Kris Truini of Kriscoart shares some helpful advice on making your drone shots more visually dynamic and engaging to your audience.</p>
  <p>It's not just the elements within the frame that are important, but also the elements that are about to be in the frame. Knowing the best way to reveal locations, props, and characters in a particular scene can add so much to your film's production
    value, not to mention increase your audience's interest. So, practice new aerial techniques for introducing new elements into your shots. Try panning and tilting, tracking your subject, getting a bird's eye view, and flying backward to offer your
    viewer new visual information, as well as new perspectives.</p>

    filmmaking tools.</p>
