      <h1>AJAX and ME</h1>
      <p>By Brett Jackson</p>
      <p>Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly
        the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as
        well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't
        do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were
        our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect
        you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. Fighters coming in. There's too many
        of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader. Come on. We gotta
        get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the
        deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget
        the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I
        will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah
        system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend. I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm
        rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh!
        Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling
        that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your
        magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe
        me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke!
        Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh,
        oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me. I told you to remain on the command ship.
        A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure?
        I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
        They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen
        it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you
        wish.

      <p>I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes,
        I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your

        to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish. Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You
        need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she
        means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now.
        Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too. It's a trap! We're coming! Come on! Come
        on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
        I'll cover you. Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way.
        Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!</p>

      <h1>Is XML Dead?</h1>
      <p>By Brett Jackson</p>
      <p>Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology.
        Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
        I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...
        No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around. I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them,
        coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great.
        Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh
        yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator
        has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble! Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't
        see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder!
        Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
        Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it
        easy. Excuse us, please. Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two.
        this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning.
        Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir,
        it's good to see you fully functional again. If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.
        Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy?
        You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate
        you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
        Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be
        another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know.</p>

      <h1>How Much is too much: Know your Java</h1>
      <p>By Brett Jackson</p>
      <p>There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're
        right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast
        them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if
        he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while.
        Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're
        coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck! Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What?
        Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2
        unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on! Hello there! Come here my little friend.
        Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate
        you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled
        lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his
        former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to
        be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? The battle station
        is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a
        direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for
        asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small
        one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess
        Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to
        work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from
        Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this
        princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything
        is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly
        all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative.
        We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this?
        What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!</p>

      <p>By Brett Jackson</p>
      <p>That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft
        prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers
        can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. Greetings,
        Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that
        you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your
        Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be
        mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to
        you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. Luke...Luke...Do not...Do
        not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last
        of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There
        is...another...Sky...Sky...walker. I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light
        blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick
        close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh,
        I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.
        They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims
        of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for
        mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints
        the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are
        not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively
        unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final
        stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.</p>
