        <p>The United States Parks System is comprised of 58 National Parks and 10,234 State Park. This blog serves to share my experiences and opinions as a traveller, hiker, and nature enthusiast on my quest of travelling to each National Park and as many State Parks as possible.

        <h2>Acadia National Park</h2><br>
        <h3>Location:</h3>Bar Harbor, Maine<br>
        <h3>Visited:</h3> August 2017<br>
        <p>As the only National Park on the East Coast, Acadia National Park is located in Maine, or how I like to refer to it, "almost Canada." As a man of logic, I figured, why not start there and work my way west. Also, due to how far north Maine is located, and the park's coastal location, weather was also a factor. I don't enjoy snow, or the cold, so I went in August, as the weather seemed okay during that time with days in the 80's and nights in the 50's. This was a nice break for San Antonio's days in the 100's, night's in the 100's (just kidding nights were in the 80's). Total trip length was three days, with two days of park time. For lodging, I opted for camping, so I rented a site at the Blackwood Campgrounds in advance. Arrived prior to check in, which is at noon, so I ended up having to drive around Bar Harbor, the closest town to kill some time. However, once there finding the campsite and setting up the tent was easy. I was fighting the weather, but managed to get my tent up before it started raining. I would recommend the camp site as it's in walking distance from the coast, so you easily check out and sit by the coast and hear the waves crashing on the rocks. 10 out of 10, I would recommend sitting here in the morning with some coffee and watching the sunrise. The park itself is insanely huge, with a ton of hiking trails. One of the park rangers explained that when looking at the maps and deciding the trails, any trails going north to south is achievable for the average person, any trail going east to west is difficult for the average person. The first day, it was raining and I went through the Mountain Gorge trail (north to south) and it was brutal traversing down slippery rocks, but I made it. On a dry day, I would definitely recommend this trail. The second day I tried the Beehive Trail, which actually allows you to scale rocks vertically. Don't worry, they provide you metal handles embedded into the rocks so that you are able to climb most of it like a ladder. The views from the top were amazing. I also visited Cadillac Mountain and Thunder Bay. I would recommend both for a quick trip. All things considered, this was an amazing experience and a great start to my quest to travel across all the National Parks.

        <h2>Pedernales Falls State Park</h2><br>
        <h3>Location:</h3> Spring Branch, Texas<br>
        <h3>Visited:</h3> March 2017<br>
        <p> This state park is located just west of Austin, Texas. My friends and I decided to rent a little Farmhouse on AirBnB instead of camping at this park. We stayed for two days. The first day we ate at Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood, a well-known Texas BBQ resturant which is commonly featured on the Food Network. Reviews do not dissapoint; it was amazing. The fridge back at the AirBnB also came stocked with local beers by the landlord, so the first night was pretty much perfect. The second day, we woke up bright and early and headed out to to the park. The park is not that big, so there were really only a couple of trails to choose from and we chose what looked like the longest one. The trails were kind of disappointing as they were primarily flat, so it was more of a walk than a hike. It had also rained overnight, so most of the trails were muddy. The most interesting part was the beginning of the trail, which required you to actually cross a river barefoot to get to the trails. That was fun, but the rest not so much. I wouldn't recommend coming to this park if you like difficult, stimulating or strenuous hikes. However, if you're looking for some light exercise walking on primarily flat land this may be your thing.

        <h2>Lost Maples State Park</h2><br>
        <h3>Location:</h3> Vanderpool, Texas<br>
        <h3>Visited:</h3> December 2016<br>
        <p> This state park was highly recommended as one of the best state parks in Texas. It's known particularly for all the maple trees and the scenic views caused during the period where leaves change colors in the fall. It looked amazing, at least in the pictures, because I went in the first week of December long after all the beauty had left the trees. I went with three friends and we rented a log cabin in Frio, TX. When we got there we got our cabin upgraded, because surprisingly we were the only residents on the entire compound. I guess timing really is everything. What initially seemed like an amazing "once in a lifetime" feeling of having the entire complex of cabins to ourselves, quickly became more "texas chainsaw-esque" after the sun set and the fog rolled in. Particularly creepy was the vast acreage of dormant pecan trees which were in the center of all the cabins. Through the fog you saw shadows of deer running through the pecan trees. It was creepy. Fast forward to the morning, had a great breakfast and made our way out to Lost Maples. The trails were awesome. Moderate to difficult complexity.  There were great views, a great mix of climbing up and down rocky trails, flat trails and scenic views. I would definitely recommend. Actually, I would like to return when it's fall and the trees are changing colors.
