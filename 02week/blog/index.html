      <h2 class="date-text-settings">July 22, 2017</h2><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/"><img class="float-left" src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/3m/1w/jy/xa/kDdUtDsGMQ3OYwoBtEQyJIGPz4V-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?k=0ded074d9d" title="Predestination" alt="Predestination"></a>Ethan Hawke, plays a man *wink* who makes multiple jumps to different time periods to hopefully prevent a bomber from killing thousands of people in New York City.. the history of the characters is introduced in a retelling a la "Forest Gump" but about thirty minutes in, the story telling style changes and the plot makes some jaw dropping twists. It trumps the other paradoxial time travelling golden hen, Time Crimes in the production value and acting departments. Even if it can't shake off the convoluted specifics that accompany a time travelling plot, I would recommend fans of the genre to take a look at their schedule and make some time to watch it. </div>

      piece of work. They reused all the same happenstance motifs as Prometheus.. and even in that movie they were silly. Yes ladies and gents, the homeworld of the advanced galaxy fairing Space Jockeys has an unlivable habitat.</div>

      <h2 class="date-text-settings">July 19, 2017</h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(2011_film)"><img class="float-left" src="http://wp.auburn.edu/circle/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Drive-Movie-Poster-.jpg" title="Drive movie poster" alt="Drive Movie Poster"></a>Such a great film. Ryan
      Gosling seriously redeemed himself. He managed to have enough creepy cool that he was able to shake off any charming softie stigma he may have garnered from his previous romance/drama works. Now I trust he'll do well in the upcoming BLADE RUNNER
      sequel. Back to this one, the directing was really top notch too! Though, I could of contributed some fantastic 80's revival synth wave.. If only they would've asked me! :P </div>
