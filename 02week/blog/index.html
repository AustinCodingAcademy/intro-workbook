        <h3>Pseudo Science</h3>
        <div class = "pseudo"><span id = "first">t</span>he modern day world is full of deceptions. It should come as no surprise that many of these deceptions are masquerading under the banner of "science." Unfortunately, many people are more willing to blindly believe what they hear, just as long as it's being reverberated from the scientific community. As a result, these people have come to believe falsehoods, that have no supporting evidence in the natural world. There are a number of examples of these falsehoods I can point to. However, this blog will be devoted entirely to the age of the earth and dinosaurs.</div>
        <h3>The Age of the Earth</h3>
        <div class = "age">Listening to the discourse emanating from the scientific community one would think the age of the earth has been established beyond any doubt. Reasonable and rational people can see that all the evidence clearly points to a 4.5 billion year old earth and a 13.7 billion year old universe, right? Not so, in fact, the evidence found in the natural world points to a very different timeline. Now it's true, science can't establish the age of the earth with certainity. All we can do is gather the evidence, study it objectively, and come to an unbiased conclusion. The question is, what is the most likely conclusion? Many would be surprised to learn that most of the evidence found in the natural world actually supports a young age to the earth, not old. The presence of comets, the number of supernovas, the salinity of the oceans, the rate of lunar escape, the rate of solar depletion, the presence of carbon 14 in everything (including diamonds, coal, and all fossils), the inability to attain accurate dates from carbon 14 testing, the rate of deterioration of the earth's magnetic field, the rate of accumulation of mutations in populations (genetic entropy), known population growth curves,  helium depletion from zircon crystals, radio polonium halos, soft tissue and blood in dinosaur remains, polystrate fossils that traverse several layers of strata.......etc. All of these natural processes and observations, as well as several others, are strong evidence that the earth/universe can not be billions of years old. In fact just one of these evidences alone can prove that the earth can not be old. I will discuss Carbon 14 as an example.

        Carbon 14 dating alone proves the earth is young in two ways. Carbon 14 has a half life of 5,700 years. This means after about 50,000 years there would be no detectable C14 in a subject. All carbon 14 can tell you is something older or younger than 50,000 years but no accurate date can be deduced further. If something is older than 50,000 years it would contain no C14, if something is younger than 50,000 years then it will contain C14; but again, that's it, no date can be deduced further. So here's the two big problems for old earth advocates. The first, everything on the planet ever tested for C14, tests positive for containing significant levels of C14. This means everything including diamonds, coal, and all fossils (yes, dinosaurs included). This means that everything on the planet has to be less than 50,000 years old. There is no getting around this fact. Thousands and thousands of varying samples have been tested, and never has any one thing tested negative for C14. The second problem for old earth advocates is carbon 14 dating can not yield an accurate date. The inventors of C14 dating knew that for C14 dating to work the planet had to have already reached Carbon 14 equilibrium. For the planet to reach Carbon 14 equilibrium would take about 30,000 years. Now the fact that Carbon 14 dating can not yield accurate dates is no secret. However, what is a secret, and is never discussed, is what that implies. Being unable to attain accurate dates from Carbon 14 dating can only mean one thing, the earth has not yet reached carbon 14 equilibrium, which means the earth must be less than 30,000 years old. So to sum it up, the presence of Carbon 14 in everything points to the earth being less than 50,000 years old, and the inability to attain accurate dates from C14 testing proves the earth must be less than 30,000 years old.

        <h3>Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p class = "dino">It would be safe to say that dinosaurs are fascinating creatures. No childhood would be complete without a dinosaur or two....and it's this very fact that makes the topic of dinosaurs somewhat unique. Unlike other topics, the indoctrination that dinosaurs are from "millions of years ago" begins in our youngest and most impressionable childhood years. Perhaps, this is what makes many not open to hearing an alternative view on dinosaurs and when they lived. Truth be known, the evidence that dinosaurs have always lived along side humans is overwhelming. The word "dinosaur" was invented in 1841; before that the word used was "dragon." That's right, today's dinosaurs are yesterday's dragons. Accounts of encounters with dinosaurs/dragons are numerous, all through out history, and all through out cultures and contents. The "Historia Animalia," from the 1,500's, records dragons as being small and relatively rare by then. Even dictionaries as recent as the early 1900's stated that dragons are "now rare." The evidence for dinosaurs living contemporaneously with humans is best summed up by these two documentaries.
