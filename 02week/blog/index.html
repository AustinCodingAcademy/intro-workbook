            <p class="articleTeaser">In the world of sex abuse litigation, some things change and some things never do. 
                Bill Cosby allegedly used Quaaludes and a famous television show to lure young women to his "casting couch." 
                Harvey Weinstein allegedly used his shower and his aphrodisiac and drug of choice: the promise of Hollywood movie fame. 
                Both men, however, were united in their choice of protective legal shields: the court-sanctioned use of secret nondisclosure 
                settlement agreements (NDAs), which prevented future victims from learning about previous accusations made against the media moguls.
