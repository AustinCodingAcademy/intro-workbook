    <h3>Barbara Kruger a Hero for Heroes.</h3>
    <img src="./images/BarbaraKruger-Untitled-We-Dont-Need-Another-Hero-1985.jpg" height="70%;">
</div>
  <p>    
      Barbara Kruger is best known for her silkscreen 
      prints where she placed a direct and concise 
      caption across the surface of a found photograph. 
      Her prints from the 1980s cleverly encapsulated the 
      era of "Reaganomics" with tongue-in-cheek satire; 
      especially in a work like (Untitled) I shop therefore 
      I am (1987), ironically adopted by the mall generation 
      as their mantra. As Kruger's career progressed, her work 
      expanded to include site-specific installations as well as 
      video and audio works, all the while maintaining a firm 
      basis in social, cultural, and political critique. 
      Since the 1990s, she has also returned to magazine design, 
      incorporating her confrontational phrases and images into 
      a wholly different realm from the art world. Associated with 
      postmodern Feminist art as well as Conceptual art, Kruger 
      combines tactics like appropriation with her characteristic 
      wit and direct commentary in order to communicate with the 
      viewer and encourage the interrogation of contemporary 
      circumstances.

      Yohji Yamamoto was born in 1943 in fashionable Yokohama 
      in the district of Tokyo. His mother was a dressmaker 
      and primarily responsible for opening the door to fashion 
      for her son. In 1966, he graduated with a degree in law 
      from Keio University in Tokyo but immediately enrolled 
      at the Bunka Fashion College to study fashion design. 
      He traveled to Paris on a student scholarship during his 
      time as a student there and when he graduated in 1969, 
      went to work for his mother as a dressmaker. Yamamoto’s 
      subsequent skill as a designer is connected to a great 
      extent to his first-hand understanding of dressmaking – 
      today, he is considered one of the master tailors of the 
      fashion world.

    <h3>Naturalistic Calling</h3>

      Los Angeles native and New York based visual artist, 
      Kehinde Wiley has firmly situated himself within art 
      history’s portrait painting tradition. As a contemporary 
      descendent of a long line of portraitists, including 
      Reynolds, Gainsborough, Titian, Ingres, among others, 
      Wiley, engages the signs and visual rhetoric of the h
      eroic, powerful, majestic and the sublime in his r
      epresentation of urban, black and brown men found 
      throughout the world. By applying the visual vocabulary 
      and conventions of glorification, history, wealth and 
      prestige to the subject matter drawn from the urban 
      fabric, the subjects and stylistic references for his 
      paintings are juxtaposed inversions of each other, 
      forcing ambiguity and provocative perplexity to pervade 
      his imagery. Wiley’s larger than life figures disturb 
      and interrupt tropes of portrait painting, often 
      blurring the boundaries between traditional and 
      contemporary modes of representation and the critical 
      portrayal of masculinity and physicality as it pertains 
      to the view of black and brown young men.

    <h3>A Pair Made for Design</h3>

      Charles Eames (1907–78) and Ray Eames (1912–88) gave 
      shape to America's twentieth century. Their lives and 
      work represented the nation's defining movements: the 
      West Coast's coming-of-age, the economy's shift from 
      making goods to producing information, and the global 
      expansion of American culture. The Eameses embraced the 
      era's visionary concept of modern design as an agent of 
      social change, elevating it to a national agenda. Their 
      evolution from furniture designers to cultural ambassadors 
      demonstrated their boundless talents and the overlap of 
      their interests with those of their country. In a rare era 
      of shared objectives, the Eameses partnered with the federal 
      government and the country's top businesses to lead the charge 
      to modernize postwar America. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Charles Eames grew up in 
      America's industrial heartland. As a young man he worked 
      for engineers and manufacturers, anticipating his lifelong 
      interest in mechanics and the complex working of things. 
      Ray Kaiser, born in Sacramento, California, demonstrated her 
      fascination with the abstract qualities of ordinary objects 
      early on. She spent her formative years in the orbit of New 
      York's modern art movements and participated in the first 
      wave of American-born abstract artists.
