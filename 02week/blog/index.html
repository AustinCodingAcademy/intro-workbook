<h1><span class="book">The Sheriff of Yrnameer</span> by Michael Rubens</h1>
  <h2>****</h2>
    <p>In this rollicking space adventure, our not-quite anti-hero has to decide between saving his own skin and doing good... or does he?
      Down on his luck Cole finds himself in the middle of a rescue mission to the most idyllic of all places... the rumored last of the
      Your Name Here colonies.  But he's got Kenneth after him for gambling debts, and Kenneth isn't the easiest creature in the universe
      to shake off.  Can Yrnameer be the place that saves him?  Can Cole be the human that Yrnameer needs to save it?</p>

<h1><span class="book">Avian</span> by Nicole Conway</h1>
  <h2>*****</h2>
  Excellent second book of the dragonrider series by Ms. Conway.  Continues the journey of the half-breed gray elf and human, and his friends.  His patron has suffered
  an attack and can no longer ride.  His new trainer teaches him even better.  The ranks of the dragonriders become divided over additional threats.  Are his new powers
  to blame or is there some other source of the wild animals attacking everyone?  Very suspenseful, and the ending is a cliff-hanger.  Can't wait to read the final book!

<h1><span class="book">Fledging</span> by Nicole Conway</h1>
  <h2>*****</h2>
  <p>Fantastic first of three books about dragons and the young people who ride them.  This first book follows a half-breed, child of a grey elf woman and human father,
    who is left behind at 12 when his elvish mother dies.  He goes to live, unwanted, at his human father's house.  Small and frail for his age, he is
    misunderstood and bullied.  When his craftsmen father finally takes him to the dragon's training ground, he is drawn to them, and unbelievably
    to the established hierachy, chosen by a wild, untamed dragon.  His life changes dramatically as a dragonrider, and he learns to soar!
