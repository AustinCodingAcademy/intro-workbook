      <h2>The Best Way to Make Cold Brew Coffee Is Also the Handsomest</h2>
      <h3>The thing contains the entire cold brew-brewing process inside itself, which means all you need to do is dump some grounds into the little insert, fill the jug with water, and let it sit for a day. When you remove the insert, bang it around the rim of your trash can until all the wet coffee ground guts fall out, rinse it in the sink, and set it aside for the next time you use it.</h3>

      <h2>How to Turn Your Cold Brew Coffee into a Cocktail</h2>
      <p>Mezcal is tequila’s bolder, smokier cousin—and it plays great with bitter cold brew. Laman likes to amp up the bitter by using a chicory-laced cold brew for her mezcal drinks. (For the uninitiated: chicory is a bitter root often brewed with coffee,
        particularly in New Orleans). To turn the whole thing into one “damn fine coffee cocktail,” she sweetens it up with horchata, Mexico’s famed sweet, cinnamony, rice-and-nut based drink that you can probably buy at your local fancy grocery store.
