<p>I was born in Arkansas, and raised/lived in East Texas until I moved to San Marcos in 2016, where I resided until I graduated from Texas State University in May 2018 with my BFA in Theatre Performance & Production, and currently reside in Austin. Eventually after ACA, I plan on moving to Vancouver, BC and pursue an acting career, while coding from home and auditioning during the day.</p>
