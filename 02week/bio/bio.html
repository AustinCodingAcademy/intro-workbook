 <h1><center><u>Alex Dunagin</u></center></h1>
 <p><center>I was born in Arkansas, and raised/lived in East Texas until I moved to San Marcos in 2016, where I resided until I graduated from Texas State University in May 2018 with my BFA in Theatre Performance & Production. After Coding School, I plan on moving to Vancouver, BC and pursue an acting career, while coding from home and auditioning during the day.</center></p>
