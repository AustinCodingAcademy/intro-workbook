            <p> I have lived in Austin for about 17 years. I graduated from UT with a business degree in 2004 and have been in sales/account management locally ever since.</p>
            <p> I am happily married to my beautiful wife, Kirsten. We have one fur baby named Joon (pictured above). </p>
        <p> I love interior design, crafting, and DIY projects. My wife and I started an Instagram account for our DIY projects called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/re_thunkjunk/?hl=en"> Re_ThunkJunk.</a> </p>
        <p> I love wine, the outdoors, fishing, camping, music (especially on vinyl), living room dance parties, good food, cooking and hanging with my peeps! </p>
