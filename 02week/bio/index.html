    <p>Nick Andrews has always wanted to be a professional musician. Even before he played his first guitar at the tender age of 6, music has been the center of his world for as long as he can remember.</p>

    <p>Nick has come a long way as both an artist and as a person due to the hardships and fears he has had to overcome. At a young age, several people told Nick time and time again that his dream was just that - a dream, and that he should let it go and
      focus on goals that are more realistic. But with great moral support from his his family and close friends, for whom he is grateful, Nick never strayed from his desire of becoming a professional musician. But two injuries as a 3-year letterman for
      his high school football team almost cost him his dream. During his junior year, major surgery was required when he suffered multiple fractures to his thumb during a football game. The surgery required the use of titanium to hold the shattered bone
      that otherwise would not heal. His recovery required months of physical therapy and rehabilitation to help regain the movement in his hand. The second injury happened his senior year when Nick suffered a dislocated elbow. To make matters worse,
      the injury to his elbow resulted in a set back of all the work he had put in to rehabilitating his thumb. Because of these two injuries, Nick was unable to play guitar for more than 18 months. But with great determination and a passionate focus,
      he managed to regain his ability to play his beloved guitar. Truth is, playing the guitar again was never in doubt; giving up his dream was not an option. In fact, with great perserverance, Nick was able to take his craft to another level.</p>

    <p>In 2002, Nick attended the University of Texas Pan-American. There he enrolled in the Music of Performing Arts bachelor degree program. During his studies at UTPA, Nick received classical training in guitar performance. While at UTPA, he played on
      many guitar ensembles representing the universitys music department. He also had the opportunity to help tutor some of his fellow students enrolled in the degree program. In 2006, Nick decided to take his musical education to Hollywood, California
      where he attended the world famous Musicians Institute. There he enrolled in the Guitar Institute of Technology Associates program, where Nick learned the arts of Fusion, Blues, and Jazz. While in Hollywood, Nick played with many different up-and-coming
      artists with styles ranging from Country/Rock, Blues, and Jazz/Fusion music. In 2008, Nick graduated with honors from Musicians Institute and is currently pursuing other musical opportunities.</p>

    <p>Nick has both shared the stage with, and learned from, several great artists, including: Jake Eckert (Dirty Dozen Band, New Soul Underground), Stewart Ziff (War), Ken Stieger (Project Stieger), Alex Machacek, Antti Kotikoski, Allen Hinds (Artist/LA
      Session player/Gino Vinelli), Dan Gilbert (MI Director of Programs/Instructor), Bruce Buckingham (Michael Jackson), Dale Turner (Writer for Guitar Player Magazine), and Maurice Verloop.</p>
