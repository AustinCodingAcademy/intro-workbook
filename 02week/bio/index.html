        <p role="article" class="lead">I&#39;ve been a musician all my life, and went as far as I could in it academically &#40;specifically in composition&#41;, obtaining my Ph.D. in 2004. The usual career route for holders of doctorates is to pursue a professorship, and tenure. However, I was never interested in a life in academia, preferring the freedom I already had working as a pianist and organist and doing side jobs to supplement my income, as well as teaching piano privately. I have survived in this this way for over 20 years, but in the past two years have begun to teach myself languages and skills needed to work as a Web developer, having realized all too late in life that I should have been coding all along, because I enjoyed it so much. My journey thus far has culminated in my enrollment at Austin Coding Academy, where I expect to better organize the knowledge I already have, fill in the most gaping holes in it, and begin to focus my skills more and delve deeper into the areas in which I&#39;m most interested -- once I know what they are. Although a couple of years in as an autodidact, at least as of today, I&#39;m a beginner.</p>
