   <h2>A little about me..</h2>
   <h3> I'm from a small town called Alice, Texas. It's a small oil field town
     with a population of about twenty thousand people. I never imagined I would
    find myself in living in Austin, Texas but I am sure glad I moved here. I
    made the move to Austin back in 2009 where I completed the Pharmacy Technician
    Program at Southern Careers Institute, and immeditately landed a part-time
  job compounding at an independent pharmacy which eventuall led to full-time.
  However, for a little while now I have been at the limits of my position monetarily
  speaking. Thus, my career change has commenced, and the first step was enrolling
  into the Intro class offered by Austin Coding Academy, and I feel like I am making the
  write choice by getting into coding because I have always loved computers.

 <h4>More personally, I have a handful of hobbies that I love to make time  for.
 First off, I love gaming. Mostly racing simulators (Project CARS, Assetto Corsa),
but I also love shooters, especially when it involves shooting the dead. I also
love entertaining my two cats, Dexter and Swirl. They are both rescues and I love
them to pieces. I also have a love for making music. I used to play the electric
guitar in high school, and I recently picked it up again a little, but I have been
focusing on learning about synthesis (Synthesizers) and I find great pleasure in
 making time to have jam sessions with myself or friends with my entry-level synthesizers.
I also like photography. I purchased an entry-level digital SLR camera and have taken
a class learning about photography. I enjoy taking my camera when I know there will
be plenty of opportunities to snap some artisitc photos, or at events such as any of
the race events that take place at Circuit of the Americas, camping trips, family
get-togethers, or when there's a request from a friend to bring it. Speaking of
Circuit of the Americas, the last hobby I'd like to talk about, which is actually more
of a passion, is road racing. If you're unfamiliar with road racing, basically there
are events that take place at race tracks (circuit-type tracks, not drag strips) that
which allow for people like you and me to sign up with an appropriate vehicle
and you actually drive on the track with other drivers in their cars. Usually you begin
with an instructor riding along with the driver to make sure the driver is aware
of the flags and know how to react to each flag, making sure they are aware of their
surroundings, and that the driver has a basic understanding of how the car will react
when the driver starts to push their limits. It's a great place to truly learn your
car and how it will react in certain situations, moreover learning how to react accordingly.
Eventually you can work your way up to driving more competively where there is open-passing (in
the beginning stages of road racing, you have to signal to other drivers before they are
allowed to pass you), and you're either competing for time against other drivers/cars that
are in your given class, or even get into wheel-to-wheel racing where you're racing for position. I have
a bucket-list of race tracks around North America that I would love to drive my Honda
S2000 at. </h4>
