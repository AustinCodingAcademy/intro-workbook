  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm from Houston, Texas. I've lived here all my life. From a young age I was very athletic, playing baseball, football, soccer, and basketball since age 6.
     I rode this athleticism as far as I could, resulting in a college football career. In the end, though, I got hurt one too many times to keep playing football so I transferred
     to the University of Oklahoma. At OU, I am a double major and am pretty involved on campus. I joined a fraternity, ran for officer positions, and participated in a lot of
     fundraising drives both for local initiatives as well as things close to home, like the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. One thing I'm particularly proud of is my fundraising effort
     for Harvey; we raised nearly $5,000 for the Houston Food Bank and paid for over 10,000 meals.

    I have a puppy that looks a lot like this. I kind of devote my life to him, like walking him three to four times a day. <br /> He sits in my lap basically constantly, especially throughout this course.
