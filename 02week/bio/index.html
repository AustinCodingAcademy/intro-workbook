        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p class="lead">I have been a musician all my life, and I went as far as I could in the area in which I pursued advanced academic studies, namely composition, obtaining a Ph.D. in 2004. The standard career route for doctors of philosophy is, of course, to pursue a professorship, and tenure. However, I was not interested in living my life within academia, preferring the freedom afforded by freelancing as a pianist (I work primarily as an accompanist), and doing side jobs both in and outside music, as well as teaching piano privately. I have survived in this this way for over 20 years, but, due in part to increasing financial pressures, have, in the past two years, begun to teach myself languages and skills needed to work as a Web developer. This process has now culminating in my decision to attend Austin Coding Academy, which I expect to help me organize the knowledge I have already assimilated, fill in the most egregious gaps that remain in it, and, in general, solidify my prospects for embarking on a second career as a qualified professional -- ready at that point to REALLY begin learning, on the job.</p>
