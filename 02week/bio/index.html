    <p>Hello! My name is Shelby Inloes. I hope you take time to get to know me. This page only scratches the surface of all that makes up a persons life and personality, but its worth a shot. <br /> <br /> I was born and raised in a small town in Ohio and somehow found myself 24 years later in beautiful Austin, Texas. Somewhere inbetween I also spent some time in Hattiesburg, Mississippi for schooling! All of that traveling around has led me to love traveling, but love going home even more. </p>
