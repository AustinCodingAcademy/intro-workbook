  <h2>The Journey of Me</h2>
  <ul class="input-list style clearfix">
    <p align="right"> Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity
			but in doing it. ~ Aurhtor Ashe <br /><br />

			My journey is based on a passion in the aquisition of skills. I am extremely growth-oriented, and will
			seize any opportunity to improve, listening to and acting on criticisms, as long as they are
			logical ones, and strive to improve my knowledge.  Regardless of the challenge, big or small, and they
			firmly believe that given enough time and resources, I can achieve any goal.

			Using this positive atirbute I have obtained the following skills and ceritifications: Assembly,
			Android, SQL , CSS, HTML5, MVC, MVVM, PHP Slim Framework, UX, UI Design, JavaScript, Knockout, Angular,
			Databases, Web FrontEnd Development, Windows Universal Development, Objective-C and iOS Development,
			C# and .NET Technologies.
