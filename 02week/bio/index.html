        <h1>Who's this guy?</h1>
        <div class="slider">
          <p>To describe me in full would take a novel to explain.  To summarize it into one word, you could refer to me as chill. Although, there are several layers under this chill personality.  I have a heart full of compassion and deeply care for my friends and close family.  Anytime they need a helping hand, I offer my services.  You bought a new home and don’t have the money to hire an electrician to hang a few ceiling fans?  This guy is there to help.  Want to learn how to change your own oil and save 40 bucks? Call this guy.  Do you need someone to talk to? Again, this guy. You get the point.  I love my people, and once you are in my bubble, I will always be there for you.  Then there is the professional side of me that can flip the switch when needed.  Sure, I have compassion and respect for others, but I also have a logical mindset and know how to lay down the rules with reason.  Therefore, I’m good at presenting unpopular decisions in a way that offers an alternative solution to the initial problem.  For that, I consider myself an analytical problem solver.  I quite frequently gather supporting data to back the facts while also identifying the alternative solution.
				</p></br>
        <p>Today I’m a very skilled accountant at Whole Foods Market, Inc. I have strived in my role and have created several processes that have been very much appreciated and acknowledged by my peers.  While I enjoy what I do, I want to seek out other passions that I’ve had in life.  I started my educational journey with a goal of computer science in mind.  I was strongly discouraged from this path by family in lieu of a safer career route – hence accounting.  So my journey is now pointing in a new direction where I’m beginning to focus on web development to see where this can take me.
