    </a>

  <p>My name is Hunter Conley and I am a 23 year old student currently taking web devolpment classes with Austin Coding Academy out of Austin, Texas. I began taking interest in the computer science field in middle school while playing around with html codes for Myspace profile layouts. Once in highschool, I soon decided that was the career
    path I wanted to follow.</p>
