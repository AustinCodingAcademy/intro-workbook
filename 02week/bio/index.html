    <header><h1>Dwayne Missouri</h1></header>
   <p>Dwayne was born in Germany on December 23rd, 1978. He grew up as a military
     brat, moving between Germany and Ft. Meade army base in Maryland. His father
     would then be stationed at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX when Dwayne was
     entering the 6th grade and San Antonio would become the place that he would
     consider "home". He attended
     Theodore Roosevelt High School on and played for a football team that would
     go 16-0 in his senior year, win the State Championship, and finish ranked #4
     in the nation, while producing 5 future NFL players including Carlyle Holiday,
     who would eventually receive the pass from Brett Favre which made him the NFL's
     all-time career passing yardage record holder.
   </p>
   <p>After graduation, he attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Il on a
     full athletic scholarship. During his time at Northwestern, he would win 2
     Big Ten Championships and gain All-Big Ten honeors twice before graduating
     in 2001 with a B.S in Communications Studies. He would then get chosen by
     the World Champion Baltimore Ravens in the 2001 NFL draft. His NFL career
     would continue with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers as he was able
     to live and play in locales such as Berlin, Scotland, Amsterdam, and Barcelona,
     Spain. He would also go on to enjoy a 6 year career in the Arena Football League
     where he would play for teams owned by Jon Bon Jovi and Jon Elway in Philadelphia
     and Denver, respectively.
   </p>
   <p> Once retired from football, he would return to the Alamo City and earn his teaching
     certification in the area of Special Education. His first job was at Earl Warren
     High School in the Northside Independent School District on the coaching staff
     of Bryan Dausin, his head coach during his time at Roosevelt High School.
     He taught World History primarily, but also World Geography, and U.S. History.
     After 6 years at Warren, he was hired at McCollum High School of the Harlandale
     Independent School District with the opportunity to serve as the Defensive Coordinator.
     After 2 years of coaching at McCollum, while serving as the director of the In School Suspension
     Program, he decided to take a leap of faith and enroll at San Antonio Coding Academy
     in pursuit of a career change.
