        <section>
          <p>I have dedicated the past 25 years helping people through their spiritual journey. The majority of my career has focused on leading creative-arts and media teams. I am a musician who loves to dabble in digital media and I'm currently training to become a full stack web developer.

My life outside of work focuses on my family of six. I am married to a wonderful woman who is an English teacher for an online high school. We are blessed with four daughters who are self-professed "nerds" that love all things tech and express themselves through various forms of art.

I am an artist at heart who strives to communicate truth with excellence in all that I do. My hope is that through my talents and service, I can help others live a better life</p>
