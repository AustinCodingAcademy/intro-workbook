            <h2> Takashi Murakami (村上 隆 Murakami Takashi, born February 1, 1962) is a Japanese contemporary artist. He works in fine arts media (such as painting and sculpture) as well as commercial 
               media (such as fashion, merchandise, and animation) and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts. He coined the term "superflat", which describes both the aesthetic 
               characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of post-war Japanese culture and society, and is also used for Murakami's own artistic style and that of other Japanese artists he has influenced.
