      <p>Howdy, I'm Mark Hinojosa. I'm from a small Texas town called Santa Rosa which is nestled right in the center of the Rio Grande Valley. For the unfamiliar, that's located in the southern most tip of Texas. You might be wondering "how big is Santa
        Rosa ?"well there were 78 people in my graduating class.</p>
      <br>
      <p>From there I went on to get an Associates of Mechatronics technology from Texas State Technical College Harlingen, Texas. There my understandings of logic and electronics were put to the test. It was a great time of self growth. During this time
        I also was part of an instrumental band called The Child Forgives and Creates. Went on a few tours and made some great memories with friends.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        After graduation, I was picked up by Chevron. The majority of their available positions were in West Texas/Eastern New Mexico and so I went. What a time of transition! New culture, new environment, new friends! In late 2015 the oil field was taking massive
        hits from the price drop of oil.</p>
