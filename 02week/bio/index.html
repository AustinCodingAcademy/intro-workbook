    <h1> About me </h1>
    <img src="windows-10.png">
      <p> Hi! I'm Chris Lu. My love for computers began with Windows. I've always been around and fascinated by computers and it kicked off when Windows 10 was released. Basically, I got nerdier as I learned more about the inner workings of computers. Now, I get to learn
      about the inner workings of websites (and hopefully more things). Currently, I'm enrolled in Austin Coding Academy in hopes of being a professional
    developer of some sort one day. I'm only 20 years right now, but I hope that I can catch up and be successful with this education! </p>
