          Hello!
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website. I'm Charles, a student of coding with <a href="austincodingacademy.com">Austin Coding Academy</a>,
          a world music enthusiast &amp; amateur throat singer, a scholar of Erotic Greek poetry, and a certified permaculture designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Austin, Texas and always find myself back here when I leave. The grackles are my favorite part.

          <p>
            Currently I work for Tacodeli in Austin, Texas. I'm a delivery driver most days because I love getting out and seeing the city.
          </p>
          <P>
            Previously I have worked as a subsitute teacher for Eanes ISD; at Garden-ville in Georgetown, Texas; and at the school library of my alma mater, Southwestern University. I've enjoyed all those jobs in their own ways, because they've all been related to some of the things I love most.
          </P>
          <p>
            My strongest passions include technology and (astro)physics, history and literature, sustainble living and gardening, and open conversations about mortality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of Texas, I've visited 30 US states and lived in Washington and New York. I've also visited or lived in Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Iceland, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, Greece, and Japan. Travel invitations are always open!
