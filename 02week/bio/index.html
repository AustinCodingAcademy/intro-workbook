  <section>
  <article><p>This is my first web bio. Currently, I work at the VA as an
  Internal Controls Accountant. I've never heard of an Internal Controls
  Accountant before working there. And quite frankly, I don't like my job, but
  I do like Accounting and my boss. I started working there in June after
  quitting my job at St. David's Medical Center as a Staff Accountant in May
  2017.</p></article>
  <article><p>I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting in 2013 from Texas
  State University. I am here like most of you, I want to pursue a career change
  in software development. I've played around on Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp
  and I've learned some html, css, and javascript but with this class I hope to
  solidify what I've learn and take it to a new level of understanding and
  growth.</p></article>
  <article><p>Like I mentioned, I'm here to get a new career as a software
  developer. I'm scared, I'm excited, and I hope to learn as much as I can in
  the next nine months to start my new career. When I'm not working I love
  spending time with my family to include my beautiful wife, two puppy dogs,
  and my cat. I also like hiking, trying new foods, wine, traveling, and music.
