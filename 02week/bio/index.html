      I am based in Austin, TX where I make music for commercials and film and television. The best part of the job is the opportunity to create music in different genres. It's deeply rewarding when I finish something that works for the project and that the client loves.
My first album, Sometimes I Wonder Where They're All Going, was released in 2013 under the moniker, Cowboy, and I'm currently working on a new album that will be released in late 2017.
