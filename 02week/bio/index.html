        <p>My name is Martin Godwin and I have spent the last 15 plus years working in sales and account management.  After a lot of ups and downs I have decided to shift gears and focus my efforts on becoming a full stack web developer.  I have always loved technology, and after a few months of self-study, I became addicted to learning more about coding.  Now I am enrolled in Austin Coding Academy and I am working my way toward the career of my dreams.  I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS, and I hope to become more proficient with JavaScript in the coming months.  My goal is to land a job where I can continue to build my skills and build some really cool apps and websites in the process.  Thereâ€™s more to come so stay tuned to my progress.</p>
