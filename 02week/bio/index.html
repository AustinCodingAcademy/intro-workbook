    <p id="bio">Scott Gray is a Human Resources Specialist (Information Systems) for the Department of the Army. His position is physically located in Maryland; however, he works remotely from his home in San Antonio, TX. In total, Scott has worked for the Department of the Army as a civil servant for approximately 10 years. He started his career in Germany, which is where he was born and raised. In total, Scott lived in Germany for 21 years before a combination of the Base Realignment and Closure of military installations he worked at and a unique opportunity to establish a new HR Office led him to settling in San Antonio back in 2011. Although his parents retired and recently moved north of San Antonio, the rest of his family all still live in Germany. He possess an Associates in Management from the University of Maryland-University College. His hobbies include woodworking, long distance biking, mountain biking, spending time with his two dogs and organizing and hosting social events for others through a group he runs on Meetup.com.</p>
