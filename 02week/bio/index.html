    <p class="sansserif">William Cruz is a student of Austin Coding Academy working on his front end developer career. He has already immersed himself in tech by creating his own website and diving in on the world of mining Crypto-currency. William is fascinated with how ideas go from the drawing board to reality and is looking forward to being a part of the industry.
      In the meantime you can find William studying music and playing guitar, something he has done since he was 16. He also loves teaching music theory and playing in his band.
