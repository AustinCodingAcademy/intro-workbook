 <h1>Biography</h1>
<div class=para>
<br><p lang="en">My name is James Alan Eberwine.
I was born and raised in San Antonio. I went to a private Christian school throughout
elementary and middle school before attending Theodore Roosevelt High School. I then
 went to Texas A&M in College Station for a year before transfering
to the Univerity of Texas at Austin. There I got my degree in linguistics with a minor in
English. I was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. During and after college I worked at
the Texas Senate, first as a messenger and then with Senate support services and as an
assistant Sergeant at Arms. Since then I have worked as a legal and administative assistant
and in 2017 I got my Texas real estate license.</p>
