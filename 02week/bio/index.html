    <!--About Me-->
    <section class="Me">
      <p>
         My name is Savannah Merritt, I am 18, and I live in Liberty Hill,
         Texas. I aspire to be a programmer in the video game industry, where
         I can help code and program some of the next big future releases. I
         started computer programming when I was 15, where I was invited out to
         San Fransisco, California by the National Youth Leadership Forum in
         Technology and Inovation. There, I put in long hours and learned how
         to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and programs such as Unity. It was there
         that I discovered my passion for computer programming and saught to
         deepen my understanding and knowledge of the field. Today, my skills
         also include the languages Python, Arduino, and Bootstrap and are
         constantly expanding.
