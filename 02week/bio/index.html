    <p>Hello! My name is Shelby Inloes. I hope you take time to get to know me. This page only scratches the surface of all that makes up a persons life and personality, but its worth a shot! <br /> <br /> I was born and raised in a small town in Ohio and somehow found myself 24 years later in beautiful Austin, Texas. Somewhere inbetween I also spent some time in Hattiesburg, Mississippi for schooling. All of that traveling around has led me to love discovering new places, but love going home even more. <br/>
      <br />Living in Austin gives me plenty of oppoturnity to enjoy my previous hobbies as well as find new ones. Experiencing new things is the greatest reason I love to move to a new city. Austin has it all - a great food scene, water sports, hiking/biking trails, and culture. If I am not at the park with my crazy dog Zoey, I am playing sand volleyball or finding some nice eats (sometimes all in one night). The other best part about Austin is the ammount of opportunity there is here - for anything! I love that I have started to experience new types of people that have shown me oppoturnities for new passions in life.</p>

    <p>My passions revolve around a lifetime of learning. Although I went to school for something other than computer science, I am not diving into the world of web development. The funniest part to that transistion is realizing just how many similarities you find within different fields. I had a passion for the human body (hence - the kinesiology degree and phsychology minor) and how it worked. I was able to see and feel what they were teaching in class all around me. Now that I have started learning more about the tech world, it all seems so simliar. We are all just here trying to learn more about a subject - how it works, how we can manipulate it, and the incredible things we can do with it.</p>
