    <h3 class="Titles">Career</h3>
    <p>
    I am a dedicated student passionate about learning and applying that to
    find a career I can enjoy and be proud of. I have been searching for
    this path for over fives years, after previously being unable to decide what
    I wanted to do. I went to college for two years unable to find a passion. So
    I am very excited to finally find a career path I feel motivated towards. I
    currently have been working in the Bingo industry for seven years.

  <h3 class="Titles">Personal</h3>
    I would describe myself as very meek and introspective. I'm constantly thinking
    about the next task ahead, to a fault. I have to tell myself specifically to
    stop thinking so much, and just concentrate when needed. I would also say I
    am a big worrier of the people around me. I can never have a good time if
    someone else isn't. But on top of all this, I am definitly a positive person
    that always sees the glass as half full. I currently live in a duplex with
    my girlfriend in a duplex in Austin, Texas, and life is pretty good.
