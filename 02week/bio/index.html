      <h4>About Me:</h4>

      <p>My name is Ken and I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In kindergarten, I was part of an inaugural Spanish immersion program which I continued until the 7th grade. After high school and a small break in education in attempt to be a rockstar drummer,
        I returned to my education at Tulsa Community College to begin my collegiate studies. I then transferred to study full time at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma where I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in December
        of 2004. Currently I am attending Austin Coding Academy and hope to change careers for my future.</p>
      <p>My first job was a shipping manager for data storage company while I was still in high school. I had a brief escapade of a career in internet sales for a drum store for a few months. Before returning to college full time, I was a storage clerk and
        courier for a property and title company. I then learned what it is like to earn a true days living working at Red Lobster as a dishwasher and line cook in Stillwater while in college. After graduation I moved to Austin, Texas where I continued
        to work for Red Lobster as a culinary professional for a couple years until I found a job at Austin Recovery. I have been there for ten years helping nurses work overnight in detox, working as residential care staff for inpatient drug and alcohol
        treatment, and finaly the position I currently work in as admissions intake staff. I am looking to change careers to a future in tech as a web developer.</p>
      <p>Currently I enjoy going to see rock concerts with my girlfriend Lisa, playing with my black lab Bunny, playing drums for the band Strange Squares, and learning to code.</p>
