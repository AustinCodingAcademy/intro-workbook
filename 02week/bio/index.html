       <p>Things were fine in my early life, I thought. I was born in 1971 in a
        small town in Mexico. I lived in Mexico til about 10 years old and that's
        when my parents had decided to move to California. One of my first impressions
        that I have of the U.S. is of all the different types of neon signs lit up at night in the
        neighborhood convenience stores. We had moved to San Jose, California, a beautiful
        city. One of my older brothers was very big on going to college and so college became
        one of my goals. My older sister also went on to college and became an elementary
        teacher. At that time a teaching career was not my favorite career, but I never
        looked down at it. As we got older we decided to move down to Texas. And so we moved
        to another small town called Seguin. As the years went by I moved to San Marcos and
        Austin. I finished my college at Texas State University.
