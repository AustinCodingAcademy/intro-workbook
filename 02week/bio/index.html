      <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am 23 years old and I'm from Austin, Texas. I have two beautiful daughters and a loving husband. I recently got into programming to start a new career. Currently, I am a stay-at-home-mom and I attend night classes at Austin Coding Academy. I have a newfound passion for UX/UI design and front-end development and I hope to be able to work in the field very soon. When I'm not studying or momming, you will most likely find me reading, playing games on our Switch, or crocheting. </p>
