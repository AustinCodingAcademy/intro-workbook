      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        My adventure started in Alaska when I was born to a Nanette and Mark Fissell. From Alaska, I ended up in a town west of Houston, Texas named Katy. I attended Seven Lakes High School where I exceled at sports and ended up choosing a college based on sports rather then education. <br><br>
        I graduated from Texas State University with a degree in Management. After graduation I pursued a management position at Mattress Firm where I quickly climbed ranks to district trainer where I develop new hires into successful managers. Recently I have been redirecting my career toward computer programming. I am currently attending Austin Coding Academy to become proficient in web development.
