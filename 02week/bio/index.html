<h1>Eva Thomas' Bio</h1>
<h2> Mother, Friend, Hardworker</h2>
<h3>About Myself</h3>
<p>
  I am a 28 year old that aspire to be a Web developer and Software Engineer. I have been through some hard times in my life and have let much affect me because of it... But I know that If I persist, I will succeed.
  </p>
<p>
  I am also mother of a 7 year old and hardworker for myself and family. I just hope and pray for the best of myself and the world around me. I have traveled to many countries and worked and trained as a chef. I decided that a new career in something such as using my creativity and mild computer skills will allow me to better myself in this new field.
