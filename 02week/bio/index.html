      Hi! My name is Matt and congrats you found me on the web.  Since you have
      made it all this way, let me tell you a little about myself I'll try to keep
      it short and keep your attention.  Born and raised in Seattle, WA.
      I just like most other kids I attend Elementary, Middle and High School.
      Graduated in 2002.  I decided not to attend College.  I bought an RV with 3
      of my friends and traveled the country.  etc.... etc.....
