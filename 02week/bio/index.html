    <p id="bio">
      I'm a designer, creative director, artist and illustrator with 17 years experience in marketing and advertising.
      I've worked on some of the largest brands in the country at major agencies in Chicago, IL and that
      experience has made me a well rounded designer with a few non-traditional skill sets that afford me a way
      of tackling problems in unique ways.
