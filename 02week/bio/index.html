    What is there to say about little old me? I'm just a simple farm boy form Northwest Arkansas who had a stronger interest in technology than shucking corn. I bounced around Arkansas, trying to find a lifestyle
    better suited to my desires. Alas, nowhere was a good fit. Dead end job after dead end job I finally decided to leave the state all together and but down some roots outside of my home state.
    There I was, my 99 Camaro filled to the brim with most everything I cared about save a bed. The journey was not brief and the roads straight as an arrow but eventually I arrived here. In this little podunk town
    I'm sure no one has heard of called Austin, Texas. Seems as though there is a booming industry with everything I had sought to put my efforts into. Now, armed with a laptop and a desire to further myself, I plunge
    head first into a new coding school. Ready to finally start a life worth living.
