      <p>
        I grew up interested in computers and playing video games. I remember when Blizzard Entertainment released the first Warcraft Real Time Strategy game.
        I enjoy tinkering with computers and started building them at a young age. I pursed this interest by getting a job at Dell building servers and Samsung making
        wafers while going to college. Computers and technology continue to be a passion of mine to this day.

        I attended Texas State University in San Marcos Texas to obtain my Bachelors degree in Accounting. Find accounting interesting for its dependence on
        logic, reason, and problem solving skills, I found myself desiring to learn more. I used this degree to obtain my first job in accounts payable at Texas Parks & Wildlife. While working in accounts
        payable an opportunity arose to assist the Application Development Team with testing the Accounts Payable Module of the Oracle 11i application being
        implemented. This experience exposed me to databases and the importance of Enterprise Resource Management Systems. Not being able to get enough so I
        returned to Texas State to obtain a Masters in Account Information Systems.

      <p>I also enjoy working on cars. It started back when I was a child and would help
        my father work on them. Once I was old enough to drive the focus shifted to
        how and make them better. I got into Auto Crossing, which is a type of competative
        racing that pushes to find the limits of you car and your own driving skill.

      <p>
        I believe there is a close corolation to why I enjoy working on cars and continue
        to purse such an endevor. It comes down to being able to see and experience the
        reward for the time and effort put into altering the car and making it drive in
        a manner that is more to my liking.
      </p>

        I learned about another aspect of tuning cars a few years ago. This relied on
        software to optimize certain aspects of the Engine Control Module. This allows
        for the alteration of fuel and time among many other things.
