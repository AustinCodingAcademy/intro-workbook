          <h2>About Me: </h2>
          <p> <em>"I am learning to trust the journey, even when I don't understand it!" ~Mila Bron</em></p>
          <p>The earliest I can remember being emotionally invested in computers was when I was a child. I am 31 years old and an only child. I can remember sitting at home for hours playing a math game that my parents installed on our home computer. </p>
          <p>Now as an adult, I find myself wanting a emotionally and mentally fulfilling career, the type of career that people say, "will never feel like a day of work if you enjoy what you do!" To me, that career is computer coding!</p>
          <p> In downtown San Antonio, where I am from, they are building a big beautiful Frost Bank building. Every time I see the building, I think about how wonderful it would be if I were able to get up and go to work for a company as prestige as that. In the next two years, I would like to be skilled in my trade, find my nitch where I excel and be able to contribute to a large corporation. </p>
          <p> I believe, a career in computer coding would be mutually beneficial for the company I work for, because I would feel fulfilled, knowing that I can make a difference!</p>
