<h2>About Me:</h2>

<p>I'm the son of an immigrant, born and raised in Texas.  Moved to Austin after living in Dallas and San Antonio.  My career
  has always been in a marketing capacity, although I have had the fortunate opportunity of working with some of the biggest
  brands in the world.  The marketing landscape is ever-changing and what doesn't change is the need for consumers to connect
  with content.  The way content is being delivered is very dynamic and I now see that traditional advertising will change forever.
  I look forward to see what the future of advertising will reveal.
