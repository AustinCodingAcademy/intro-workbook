        <h3>More about me:</h3>
        <p>I was born in Oklahoma but mostly grew up in Texas.  In 1992 I graduated high school in San Antonio and then attended Texas A&M, where I obtained a Bachelors of Science in psychology degree.  After I graduated from Texas A&M in 1997, I moved to Oklahoma where I obtained an Associates in Business degree from Tulsa Community College.  During that time I secured a position in the student loan industry, where I worked for the following eight years.  In late 2006 I began working in the Oil and Gas industry, and temporarily lived in Arkansas as an independent contractor.  In 2008, I met my wife, Monica and her two young children. I continued to work in the Oil and Gas industry, eventually leaving Arkansas, working for a short time in Missouri, then securing a position in Texas in early 2010.  We relocated to San Antonio, Texas and my wife and I were married on New Year's Eve 2010.  The following year I became a father to my daughter, completing our family.  Currently, I continue to work in the Oil and Gas industry where I find myself looking for a more fulfilling and satisfying career change.</p>
