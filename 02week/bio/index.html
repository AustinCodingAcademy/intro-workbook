      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>“The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.” Albert Camus from the book The Rebel</h4>

<p>I love philosophy, thus the quote above, one of my favorites. Philosophy deals with the hard, unanswerable questions of life which is why I love it. Some of my favorite philosophers include Ayn Rand, Albert Camus, Marcus Aurelius, Lao Tzu, and of course, The Dude himself, Jeffrey Lebowski. I’ve lived all over the United States. When you’re young and move around a lot you are forced to dive internally. Guess that’s another reason I’m drawn towards the philosophical. I attended high school in Chicago and consider it my home because it had the biggest impact on me. I was born in Atlanta, GA and have lived in San Diego, CA, Hattiesburg and Jackson, MS, Macomb, IL, and Keller, TX. Oh, and I now reside in Austin. I’ve also visited most of the 50 states. “Baseball has been berry berry good to me,” (SNL-look it up!). I am a die-hard White Sox fan. I probably watch baseball every day. My other passion, you ask? Movies. Have you ever seen Bull Durham? It combines 3 important things: philosophy, baseball, and movies. You should make a point to see it. I also enjoy fishing, being outdoors in general, and playing tennis. Recently, I’ve been bitten by the coding bug and am currently taking classes to switch career fields into web development. So, there you have it, me, Andrew Cisewski, in a nutshell. Go Sox!
