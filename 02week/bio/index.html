<h1> Hey, you found me! </h1>

<p>  My name is Meghan McQueen and I hand-crafted this bio webpage for your
  viewing pleasure - yes, YOU specifically!  I am new to Austin, Texas, by way of
  Vancouver, Canada.  I'm pretty happy to be here mainly because...TACOS!  My passion
  and professional background is in Makeup Artistry, I'm all about aesthetic!
  I am <em>very</em> new to coding but I'm looking forward to becoming a future
  Front-End Developer.  That's all for now folks, thanks for reading!
