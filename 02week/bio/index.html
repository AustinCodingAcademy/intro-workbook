      <p>
        Hi! My name is Matt and congrats you found me on the web.  Since you have
        made it all this way, let me tell you a little about myself I'll try to keep
        it short and keep your attention.  Born and raised in Seattle, WA.
        I just like most other kids I attend Elementary, Middle and High School.
        Graduated in 2002.  I decided not to attend College.  I bought an RV with 3
        of my friends and traveled the country.  I eventually landed in Austin. Where
        I still live today with my beautiful wife and son.
