    <h2>Hello, a bit about me:<br></h2>
    I’m currently a Product Manager at USAA with our investment company where I’ve worked for the past 7 years.
    I got into product management by way of my previous role in Digital Marketing. Through working with other PMs, I discovered that I loved working with customers. I enjoy listening to customers, understanding what their problems are, and figuring out how technology can simplify their lives. This is especially true in the fintech industry, where such a large majority of Americans need financial advice.
    In my current role as a PM I’m working on transforming our business model due to changing market dynamics, as well as enhancing the experience and effectiveness of our landing pages.
    Outside of work I enjoy traveling, music, and learning new skills. I’m currently enrolled and start school in a few weeks to learn web development at Austin Coding Academy.</section>
