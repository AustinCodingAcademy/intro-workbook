            <p>My work experience includes but is not limited to guest services, team management, front desk management, and retail management. I am a driven and task oriented person, and I love working in fast-paced environments. I always meet goals that are set for me, and I strive to be autonomous and efficient.</p>

            <p>Empathy is the defining characteristic of a successful team, and I believe that the best way to reach any desired outcome is through effective teamwork. Supportive work relationships and a stable work environment bring out the best in each individual employee, and therefor help companies reach their full potential. It is my goal as a member of any management team to apply this knowledge towards the success of the company.</p>
