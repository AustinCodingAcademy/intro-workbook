        <p>You've stumbled upon a page of an Austinite who likes to create, but mostly enjoys living in the clouds.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Okay...a bit of a vague intro, but why is the whole page empty?"</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Glad you asked, friend/bud/sir/ma'am/otherlabelthatyoufindsuittingforyourbeing.<br/>
          I want to say that it's a metaphorical representation<br/> Of the lack of substance that
          is occurung far too much <br/>In the rise of digital monopolies<br/> A lack of true, legitimate depth...</p>
      <h4>BUT</h4>
        <p>That's far too pretentious of an excuse for my current lack of skill in coding. I'll improve, yeah, but
          as most things go, it's a process that is slowly taking place.</p>
