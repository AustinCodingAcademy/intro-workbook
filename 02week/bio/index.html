    <p>
      I'm a career learner. I enjoy learning things I've always been interested in. I am a weather buff. I have always been facinated by the weather. I went into the Army National Guard after my first semester in college. My job in the National guard was a
      field meteorologist. I also became a licensed realtor. After I discharged from the Army I realized some years later I have a real passion for health and fittness. I studied fitness in college and also received two national certifications in fitness.
      I went to work for a few national fitness chains, but then decided to start my own business. I moved to Austin Texas in 2007. I still had a passion for fitness but circumstances guieded me into a career in education. I received my masters in Leadership
      in Higher Ed in 2013. My goal now is to become a web developer. I'm currently studying web development at Austin Coding Academy.
