    <p>I was born &amp; raised in a small town in southeast Texas. Several years ago I moved to Austin to pursue better opportunities. I thrive the most, both personally and professionally, when I am able to take on challenges and learn from them. I recently started a coding bootcamp as a matter of fact. The camp has afforded me the opportunity to work individually and on a team; we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays to collaborate and share in our save the coding world conversation.

      text-indent: 3%

    <p>I enjoy brainstorming with my team as well as bringing an individual idea or solution to the table. The feeling of accomplishment that occurs when a challenge has been overcome is priceless. A lot of folks state they do their best work under pressure; I agree, just not under procrastination pressure. I have not been this excited to start a new adventure since graduate school. I believe this coding certificate will complement my MBA and open new doors. I sincerely forgot how exciting learning something new can be on a regular basis. Let the coding challenge begin!</p></section>
