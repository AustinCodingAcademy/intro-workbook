    <h1>Michael Snowden</h1>

    <h3>Future web developer</h3>
    
    <p>For the past four years I have worked in the fitness industry. Working in 
        this field and helping people to achieve their personal fitness goals has 
        brought much joy into my life. I also have a very strong passion for making 
        art. On average I spend about three hours every day working in my home studio
        creating paintings, drawings, sculpture and occasionally pieces of furniture.
