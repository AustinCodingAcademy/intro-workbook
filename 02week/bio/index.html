            <p>A leader amongst the his peer's in music near and far, Osita
              Anusi II brought his critical thinking skills gained from his
              formative years as a biochemistry major at UTSA, to the Saint
              Mary's strip with his formulaic approach to having a good time
              paired with great tunes</p>

             <p>Hailing from Houston, Texas Osita spent a majority of his high
               school career in service to the community, spending years
               volunteering with the YMCA and American Red Cross.</P>

              <p>In 2009 Osita moved to San Antonio to pursue a degree in
                biochemistry and almost immediately he immersed himself in the
                San Antonio music scene starting several bands the most notable
                one being "The Bolos".</p>

              <p>Out of popular demand and necessity, Osita started Fuzzland
                Productions with fellow musician Nick Ivarra. With Their combined
                years of touring experience they were able to use connections
                they made to bring fresh music from all over the world. Within a
                short period of time Osita found himself heading a yearly music
                festival called Hangover Fest</p>

              <p> Currently Osita has been spending time working on the future
                of Fuzzland Productions ands its growth while also working
                on his personal growth and future by learning new coding
                languages that will be integral in taking the next steps towards
                changing the way live music and technology will coexist with
                one another</p>
