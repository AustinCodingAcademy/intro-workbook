        <div class="who">
            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>I am a recent college grad who fancies cooking, exercising and spending time with my husband and two dogs. Most of the time, you can find me jogging through my neighborhood, hiking with the pups or shopping at HEB. I enjoy indulging in a nice meal, laughing at funny memes and watching my dogs watch TV.</p>

        <div class="what">
            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>I got my degree in Graphic Design with an emphasis in photography. I am currently working remotely as a part-time Graphic Designer for a small start-up agency based in Abilene, Texas. The rest of my time is filled with nannying and learning how to code!</p>

        <div class="where">
            <h2>Where</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Coppell, Texas. Shortly after graduating high school, I moved to Oklahoma City where I attended college at Oklahoma Christian University. I then married my husband whose job took us out to west Texas for about a year and a half. We now reside on the east side of Austin and are falling more and more in love with the city every day.</p>
