      <h4>Eric Walz grew up in Richmond, Virginia.  Music was a part of his life from the very beginning.  He began band in third grade, and quickly fell in love.  All throughout school, he gravitated toward music-making.  He played with any school band who needed a low brass player, and helped any ensemble he could.  He became an important part of several community bands in the Richmond area.</h4>

      <h4>College brought him into the vibrant world of the Virginia Commonwealth University music program.  He continued private lessons with Dr. Ross Walter.  Dr. Walter and several other professors helped guide Eric toward deeper interests in music and human learning, educational best practices, ethnomusicology, physics of sound, and conducting.  While at VCU, he performed at the Virginia Music Educators conference, the Florida Music Educators Conference, The Kennedy Center, and Carnegie Hall.  He became the president of the VCU Collegiate Music Educators Association.  He organized a communication platform for engaging music education students with the local band directors.</h4>

      <h4>After receiving his Bachelor’s Degree in music education, Eric moved to Texas.  He became the Head of the Instrumental Music Department at Allen Academy in Bryan, TX.  He had to manage 3rd through 12th grade music/band classes.  The diversity of teaching experiences gained through Allen Academy would be difficult to replicate in another environment.  Between teaching general music, beginning band, middle school band, high school band, music theory, and an introduction to world music course, he quickly gained strong organizational and planning skills.  Upon moving to Austin, Eric helped manage his band, Best Best Best Friends.  He acted as a point of contact for various organizations looking to book the band.  He also managed approximately 40 students’ private lessons.  This meant 40 separate lesson plans, often having to plan at least a year into the future.  Eric eventually joined the band department of James E. Pearce College Preparatory Academy.  While there, the band earned straight 1s (highest possible score) on the UIL stage performance for the first time in more than a decade.</h4>

      <h4>Eric then accepted the position of Head Band Director at Gus Garcia Young Men’s Leadership Academy.  He began the band program, building the program to about 200 students.  He worked at creating stronger vertical team alignment, making himself a regular presence at both elementary schools and the feeder high school.  Students continuing in band from middle school to high school increased from 3-5 students a year to 20-30 students a year.  The amount of former Garcia students in the feeder high school band increased from about 8 to 70.  He also implemented the use of SmartMusic, CHARMS, and Google Apps into his band hall.  As well as beginning a new band program from scratch, this position also ignited Eric’s fire for civil rights and public service.  He is passionate at trying to provide an equitable education to students who live in struggling communities.</h4>

      <h4>Since 2016, Eric has been the percussion director at Wallace Middle School.  His beginner students have been exceptionally successful within the program.  In the audition process for ensemble placement for the following year, his beginners regularly outperformed or challenged older, more experienced students.  One of his beginning percussion students earned the top audition score of any percussion student in the school.  All of the double reed audition scores were within a few points of each other, demonstrating the closing gap between the younger and older students, increasing the overall quality of the band program.</h4>

      <h4>Eric is now interested in joining the coding community and industry.  He has had a passion for computers and clarity of communication since he was a child.  He has extensive knowledge of the user end of computer environments, and his building his knowledge of the designer and programmer environment.  He is interested in applying his growing skills toward delivering clear communication and a clear user interface to anyone involved.  He looks forward to entering the world of internet design and technology!</h4>
