      <h3>Here is a little about me.</h3>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring User Experience Designer and Front-End Web Developer.<br />
          I want to live in a world filled with websites that make sense and plants that don't die on me<br />
          (even my succulents aren't looking too hot).
        </p>
        <p>
          More imortantly, I am a dedicated student (and less importantly, I am an expert barista).<br />
          I graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Design last spring,<br />
          and I am starting my Master of Science in Information Studies at the University of Texas at Austin this fall.<br />
          I am taking a front-end web development class at Austin Coding Academy (and making coffee) in the meantime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I spend most of my time researching my future Cavalier King Charles Spaniel/Poodle/Bichon<br />
          mix (AKA the Cavapoochon), Google Mapping "sandwich," and trying as many free workout classes as I can.
