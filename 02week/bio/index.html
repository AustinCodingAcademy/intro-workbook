    <h1>Hello Friend!</h1>
    <p> My name is Ty Sweet, and as you'll quickly learn I'm not the greatest at
      creative writing, especially about myself.  I'm currently attending Austin
      Coding Academy to become a full-stack Javascript developer. Originally from
      <a class="town" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California" target="_blank">
      Bakersfield, California</a>, my family and I have been here in Austin a little
      over two years.  Austin feels a lot like living in California (mostly because
      most everyone here is from California - sorry about that), but is culturally
      more approachable and the people here are much more courteous and polite.
      My employment background has been in various sales roles -
      I love meeting and interacting with people and helping out in any way I can.
      Married for 22+ years, we have three awesome girls who will one day bankrupt
      us with college and weddings.  Below is a link to my resum√© as well as a
      few ways to contact me if you are interested in knowing more.  Clicking on
      my photo to the right or the link in the footer will take you directly to my site,
      where you can find my always-updated professional portfolio.  There is also
      a link to a Prince video, because who doesn't like Prince?</p>
