      <p>I am an adventurer and life enthusiast. Since I grew up in a small town in Texas but have spent my adult life in Houston and Austin, I feel am a well-rounded person with both small town approachability and city ambition.<br>
        <h2>Professionally...</h2>As a young adult with little direction, I quickly found my calling in the tech industry when I was given the opportunity to work as a computer technician at a large electronic retailer. Using my experience in this role, I landed a job with a large
        tech corporation in Houston. After a few years working as a hardware technician, I was eager to move on to something more challenging that would afford more opportunities. Currently, and for the last 7 years, I work as a software support engineer
        for a local Austin software company. Now, I am challenging myself again to grow and open doors to new opportunities: I am learning to code applications! <br><br>
        <h2>Personally...</h2>Outside of work, I am an explorer and adventurer. My love of life has pushed me to seek out new experiences, and one of the ways I accomplish this is through travel. Over the last few years, I have visited many beautiful places in both the United
        States and beyond, and I intend to travel well into my old age. My hope is to one day be able to support myself financially through freelance development work while I travel the world.</p>
