  <p> I want to live in the open road in the back of a fully customized van with my dogs in the passanger seat and a computer. Otherwise known as  the "vanlife".
      For the mean time I work as a Loss Prevention Manager with 10 years of experience in customer service.Yes,I know, sounds extremely fun. I started
      my retail career in Dallas, Texas working for Bachman Guns. Working there probably made me the person I am now. It was diffuclt in the beginning every person
      that walked in there denied my assistance, probably because I was a 18 year old girl that looked like I never held a gun in my hand, but boy where they wrong,
      I had to learn to have a certain confidence in myself, though my stay there was not long I will carry what I learned there through out my life.
      When I am not on the sales floor attempting to catch a customer with a five finger discount I occupy my days with writing and attempt to learn how to develop websites.</p>
  <p> The dream is to have my own business creating websites for small businesses. I am hoping that along the way I can use what I learn to help
      organizations that provide help to rape survivors and victims of domestic abuse since this cause dear to my heart. I want to travel but I want it to be with
      a purpose and meaning. For the mean time I'll take the job that I have now and take what I have learned to make a successful future. View my Linked in profile by clicking below.
