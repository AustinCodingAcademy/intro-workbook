    <p>Mike Mitchell is a highly experience Software QA Manager and Engineer with over 20 years experience in high tech. Born in Mountain View, CA, Mike grew up amongst the early players in Silicon Valley and eventually started working at Apple as a contract
      QA Engineer in 1995, shortly after graduating from San Francisco State University. Months before the return of Steve Jobs to Apple, Mike was one of many released from their contracts at the company; as Mr. Jobs himself later said, “We were 90 days
      from going bankrupt.” Mike began a two year stint at Adobe, working his way up to test-lead for Adobe Premiere. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In 1998, Mike returned to Apple as a contractor, and in 1999 became a full time employee in the QuickTime QA group. Mike quickly proved to be amongst the top members of the team and eventually rose to become manager of a team of 16. In 2005, Mike
      decided to move to the iMovie team, opting to return to an individual contributor role following his recent personal life change, the adoption of children. During this time he was the sole QA Engineer during the early development of the first version
      of iMovie for iOS, contributing testing and design feedback. Mike returned to a leadership role shortly there after, and grew into managing both the iOS and MacOS teams. <br>
    </p>
    <p>After nearly 19 years at Apple, Mike decided to take a small break and decide what would be next. After several meetings with a close colleague from Apple, Mike decided to join him in a new start-up venture to be located in Austin, TX. Mixing Mike's
      passion for both music and technology, the new venture was the perfect fit. Mike moved from his native San Jose, CA to Austin in the spring of 2017 to establish not only new residency, but a new chapter in his career.
