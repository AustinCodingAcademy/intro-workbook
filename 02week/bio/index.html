    <h2>Tony's Bio</h2>
    <img src="./havanese.jpg">
    <p class="bio">My name is Tony Ishak. I was born in Cairo, Egypt but grew up in the United States. I've lived in several places in New England, but spent most of my youth growing up in New Hampshirse. I still retain some of the Arabic language I grew up with. I finished college in New Hampshire and later went on to graduate school in Pennsylvania. I have worked in the healthcare industry most of my career. I don't follow sports, but I have practiced martial arts intermittently over the years. My interests are mainly centered in the political and religious realms; the two areas they say you shouldn't discuss. I'm a very opnionated and strong willed person.
