    </header>
<main>
<p>Ramona Neafie is a professional trained librarian who reluctantly fell in with this digital fad when they took away her card catalog and MARCive reference manual.</p>
<p>She found that fierce research skills and well-honed information organization habits were not entirely wasted online.</p>
<p>Her library is cataloged online using <a href="http://www.librarything.com/profile/Engnova">Library Thing</a>.  A few of the books may be her husbands'.</p>
<p>She enjoys loose tea, cooperative board games, reading obscure history, and debating ethics with her younger cat.  The older cat is a total lightweight.</p>
