      <h2>Hello, my name is Erin.</h2>
      <p>I like to create simple, beautiful designs.</p><br />

      <h3>Here is a little about me.</h3>

      <p>
        I am an aspiring User Experience Designer and Front-End Web Developer.<br />
        I want to live in a world filled with websites that make sense and plants that don't die on me<br />
        (even my succulents aren't looking too hot).
      </p>

      <p>
        More imortantly, I am a dedicated student (and less importantly, I am an expert barista).<br />
        I graduated from Texas A&M University with my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Design last spring,<br />
        and I am starting my Master of Science in Information Studies at the University of Texas at Austin this fall.<br />
        I am taking a front-end web development class at Austin Coding Academy (and making coffee) in the meantime.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of school, I spend most of my time researching my future Cavalier King Charles Spaniel/Poodle/Bichon<br />
        mix (AKA the Cavapoochon), Google Mapping "sandwich," and trying as many free spin classes as I can.
