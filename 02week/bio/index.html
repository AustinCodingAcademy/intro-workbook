          Hey I'm Wyatt Jones and this is my bio page thing. I spent too much time on the darn navigation bar that I don't really know what to type here now. I went and saw IT recently. Pretty spooky stuff, I've got to say. I watched it at Alamo Drafthouse, so I ate a pattymelt while watching the movie in a recliner. That was pretty dope. Pennywise has a pretty bad lazy eye, he should probably get that looked at. Also, he doesn't seem like the most stable individual. I don't know if he has an HOA or not, but his house is pretty dilapidated and could use some yard work. The picture on the right is a link to my resume.
