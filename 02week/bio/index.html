    <p>Hello! My name is Shelby Inloes. I hope you take time to get to know me. This page only scratches the surface of all that makes up a persons life and personality, but its worth a shot! <br /> <br /> I was born and raised in a small town in Ohio and somehow found myself 24 years later in beautiful Austin, Texas. Somewhere inbetween I also spent some time in Hattiesburg, Mississippi for schooling. All of that traveling around has led me to love discovering new places, but love going home even more. <br/>
      <br />Living in Austin gives me plenty of oppoturnity to enjoy my previous hobbies as well as find new ones. Experiencing new things is the greatest reason I love to move to a new city. Austin has it all - a great food scene, water sports, hiking/biking trails, and culture. If I am not at the park with my crazy dog Zoey, I am playing sand volleyball or finding some nice eats (sometimes all in one night). The other best part about Austin is the ammount of opportunity there is here - for anything! I love that I have started to experience new types of people that have shown me oppoturnities for new passions in life.</p>

    <p>Starting off with the typical I went to school 'here' and studied 'this' I would rather start by saying the where and why. When I was a young innocent high schooler I thought that college would be a chance for me to explore life on my own and just magically have a good job right when I graduated. I endured 18 years of cold winters and I was having no more of that, so I picked up and moved 11 hours to south Mississppi. Suprizingly, not as big of a culture shock as you would think with me coming from the midwest (my high school was literally surrounded by cornfields and I lived next to a cow pasture). I also decided I would cheer, join a sorority, and study nursing. Don't remember seeing nursing anywhere? Yeah that didn't last long. I ended up graduating with a degree in Kinesiology because I loved learning about how our bodies worked and well - I was a juinior when I switched majors so I had to choose something similar...<br /><br />Anyways, after graduation I picked up and moved again. When I got to Austin I had several jobs before landing one actually using my degree. I got to work with people, analytically think, and wear comfortable clothes to work! It was great, but still left more to be desired. I wanted to make something... tangible. When I begin to think of what I wanted long term I found out that I want a career where I can build and say 'I did this'. So much gratification and job satisfaction comes from knowing you are important. There I found myself introduced to the world of coding and heres were I begin my new journey. <br /><br />My passions revolve around a lifetime of learning. Although I went to school for something other than computer science, I am not diving into the world of web development. The funniest part to that transistion is realizing just how many similarities you find within different fields. I had a passion for the human body (hence - the kinesiology degree and phsychology minor) and how it worked. I was able to see and feel what they were teaching in class all around me. Now that I have started learning more about the tech world, it all seems so simliar. We are all just here trying to learn more about a subject - how it works, how we can manipulate it, and the incredible things we can do with it.</p>
