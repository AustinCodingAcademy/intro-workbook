  <h1>My Biography</h1>
  <p>My name is Andrew. I was born at Riverside, California. I currently live in Austin, Texas for about a year and half. I am a Korean-American. I enjoy doing golf, ping-pong, bowling, and photography. I recently picked up photography, which has been my current hobby. I have a Canon EOS 70D DSLR and I like to take pictures of old buildings, streets, and people.
 </p>

  <p>I started my interest in programming when my friends in the tech industry, introduced me about coding. In the beginning, the thought to learn coding never came across my mind, and I thought learning “how to code” meant going to a University majoring in Computer Science. I did feel a bit hesitant after speaking with my friends about the different languages in coding and just the vast amount of information to learn in programming. But, my friends encouraged me to try and give it a chance. After learning only the very basics of HTML and CSS, through an online course, I have learned that I actually enjoyed the challenge and seeing the front-end changes of a simple text or color in a website.</p>
