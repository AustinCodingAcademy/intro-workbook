    <h1>Welcome Back!</h1>
    <p>So, assuming you are reading this you must have been absolutely enthralled by my first entry and can't wait to see what I'm going to talk about next!  Or, you are forced to read this to make sure I'm doing this correctly.  If it's the former, you must be hurting for reading material.  If it's the latter, then I apologize that you have to read this poor excuse for a blog.  Hopefully you aren't actually reading the words and are just looking at the content and the styling, and hopefully those aren't too boring either.  I really do feel that we've come a long way in a few weeks so it's pretty exciting to think where we'll be in a few months (not to mention how basic all of this will look)!</p>
    <p>What I'm coming to realize is that if I really want to focus on what I'm doing I should probably be in a completely quite environment.  Or at least an environment with no visual stimulation.  Trying to complete this assignment with any sports playing is proving to be tough.  Music in the background is okay becuase I don't really focus on it, and it helps in environments that aren't completely quiet.  I'm also quickly realizing that text editing software, at least Atom with the packages I have installed, do not have any type of spell check or grammar check.  That would make any type of extensive writing a chore.  I guess you could write everything out in Microsoft Word and then copy and paste, but at this point I'm not going to worry about it (even though spelling errors drive me nuts).</p>
    <p>Okay, I think that might be enough for this go around.  I know I said last time that I would discuss specific topics but apparently I was able to ramble enough to not need it for this entry.  Probably something I will do for the next entry.  Until next time...</p>
