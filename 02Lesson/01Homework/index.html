                By MARK MAGNIER Updated Oct. 13, 2016 11:36 a.m. ET 10 COMMENTS BEIJING—Chinese exports fell more steeply than expected in September, highlighting the persistent weakness in global demand that is weighing on the world’s second-largest economy. The 10%
                year-over-year drop marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline and follows a 2.8% fall in August, the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday. The drop was also markedly worse than a median forecast of a 3.2% decline from 16
                economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Imports, meanwhile, fell 1.9% in September from a year earlier, reversing a 1.5% increase in August. The import data were also weaker than expected. The falloff in imports and exports resulted
                in China’s trade surplus narrowing to a less-than-anticipated $41.99 billion in September from $52.05 billion in August. “This data is disappointing and underlines that the fundamentals of the economy are still quite weak,” said Amy Yuan
                Zhuang, an analyst with Nordea Bank. “This will add clouds to the growth outlook.” ENLARGE Growth has stabilized recently after Beijing’s decision to pursue an accommodative monetary policy and ramp up infrastructure spending, but this
                masks deeper problems including weak private investment, mounting corporate debt and widespread industrial overcapacity, economists said. Ms. Zhuang and other economists said anemic global demand was the main reason for September’s weaker
                performance. Trade was down with all of China’s major trading partners in September. The World Trade Organization expects global trade to grow by a slack 2.8% this year, marking a fifth straight year below 3%. Robust exports a year ago
                also made the comparison with last month appear less favorable, economists said. Another factor in September’s trade fall, some said: South Korean giant Samsung Group’s production problems and recent decision to stop selling its Galaxy
                Note 7 smartphone. “China is a very important part of this supply chain,” said BBVA Research economist Xia Le. China’s overseas shipments, once an important generator of growth, have declined in 14 of the past 15 months, a drag on the
                broader economy, economists said. Some said they expected Beijing to further depreciate the yuan in coming months to make exports more affordable. “This depreciation will be gradual,” said Ms. Zhuang. “They don’t want a sharp decline”
                that might spook investors, increase capital outflow and spur financial instability, she said. The yuan has depreciated approximately 3% against the dollar and 6% against a broader basket of currencies so far in 2016. Chinatop Home Products
                Manufacturing Co., which exports kitchen supplies to the U.S., said sales have declined by about 10% this year from 2015 levels. In response, the company, which is based in the southern city of Yangjiang, has cut prices by as much as 15%
                and periodically borrows from banks to smooth out its cash flow. “The global economy is not very upbeat right now. And Americans aren’t buying as much as they used to,” said Chen Yangfan, a company salesman. “We hope that the economic
                situation will somehow recover in the fourth quarter.” Economists said September’s import decline reflected continuing weakness in the domestic economy, with lower import volumes for major commodities such as copper and iron ore. “This
                could be an early sign that the recent recovery in economic activity is losing momentum, although we would caution against reading too much into a single data point,” wrote Capital Economics in a research note. Shen Danyang, spokesman
                for China’s Ministry of Commerce, this month said foreign trade remained under heavy downward pressure, adding that the situation was “complicated and daunting” and there was no room for complacency, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
                Growing trade friction also hurts Chinese exports, Mr. Shen said. China has come under criticism from foreign officials who claim its companies are selling steel and other goods at prices below the cost of production. In the first eight
                month of the year, 20 countries or regions launched 85 trade investigations against Chinese products, a 49% increase over year-earlier levels, led by the U.S. and India, the ministry said. —Lilian Lin and Liyan Qi contributed to this article

            Jeff Legwold ESPN Senior Writer Without coach Gary Kubiak on the sideline the Broncos couldn't overcome a slow start in a 21-13 loss to the San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium. Though the Broncos eventually out-gained the Chargers in the game overall
            -- 304 yards to 265 -- the Broncos offense had just 129 yards after three quarters and the Broncos defense surrendered 10 points in the first quarter. The Broncos couldn't overcome either of those things and when Kubiak returns on Monday,
            he has to snap the team out of a two- game losing streak.

                AUSTIN - Love, scandal and a history-changing relationship are at the center of a new movie written and directed by Austin-based filmmaker, Jeff Nichols. Nichols’ latest film “Loving” premiered on day one of the Austin Film Festival and is already receiving
                Oscar buzz. "I read a few things, mostly sent to me by my parents,” joked Nichols on the red carpet Thursday night outside Austin’s Paramount Theater. All kidding aside, Nichols says he hopes “Loving” inspires moviegoers to learn about
                the true story that would lead to a Supreme Court decision invalidating any law prohibiting interracial marriage. "If it translates to people going to see the film, and it translates to people hearing about this story, this story I think
                is so, so important, it's a good thing," Nichols said. The film is based on the lives of Richard and Mildred Loving, played by actors Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga. When Nichols first started writing the film in 2012 he was inspired by
                the fight for marriage equality in the Supreme Court. However, now he said the film has also taken on a new significance. "Obviously because of the things that are happening with race relations in this country, it's not just a film about
                marriage equality, it's a film about equality in general,” Nichols told KVUE. "Loving" is in theaters on November 4th.
