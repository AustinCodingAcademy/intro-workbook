        My name is Brian Todd, I was born and raised in Austin, Tx and lived her all my life. I graduated from Pflugerville High School in 2009 and attended the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor the following fall.I played basketball for 4 years there and then
        I graduated with a degree in Computer Information Systems in December of 2013. I work as part of the technical operations team at Siemens RCS. I have been working there for 3 years and it has been a joy being apart of that team.

                        <h2><em>Plans After This Course</em></h2>
                        <p>
                            My plans after this course is to apply for a job in a company that interest me. I love where I work at and what I do but it is hard to relate and show an interest since we do energy management. It is not something that I see myself spending time on my
                            own learning about, I learn the skills but not really an interest in the product. Hopefully I will be able to get a job along a sports team or some other profession that I can build with. As of right now I am taking my time
                            and just working on my skills and letting the rest play out.
