    <h2>It's All About Me</h2>
  <p>
  Hello! My name is Collin Davis. I am a 29 year old small town boy, originally
  from Kerrville, Texas. I moved to Austin in 2003 and began my culinary adventures
  through this wild city. From Lake Austin and North Austin, down to the far reaches
  of South Austin, I have lived and worked in every part of the city. In 2008 I met
  the love of my life Stephanie, and in 2011, we started our journey into parenthood
  with our daughter Averi. By 2014 we were ready for round two and welcomed our son
  Jasper into this world. A year later we signed a mortgage on the southeast end of town,
  and became bonafide home owners! Now that we are somewhat settled, it's time to try my
  hand at something new. Coding here I come!!!
