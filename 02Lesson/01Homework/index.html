      How's it going everyone?? My name is Ryan Kirkham and thanks for checking out my page. It's still very much a work in progress so make sure to check back in the future to catch the final product. Now for a little bit about myself; I was born and raised in Colorado Springs, CO but moved to Denver, CO after I graduated high school. I lived there for roughly 4 years and now I reside in Victoria, TX. In high school, I was a four year varsity starter and three year varsity captain of the soccer team. I had two D1 scholarships and five D2 full-rides until I blew out my knee during playoffs of my senior year. I was told by doctors that the damage was so severe that I would never be able to play soccer at a high level ever again. I continued and still continue to play recreationally and also indoor. I was never a computer "geek" growing up and wasn't even that computer savy. But ever since I came across coding, I've been hooked. I've learned more about computers and the amazing things that you can do with them in the last six months than I have in my entire life.
