        Bio:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Gaming has been a fundamental part of my life ever since I can remember. My childhood was largely spent without a PC or console, so I began my lifelong gaming obsession playing various shareware titles available on my Apple computer. Escape Velocity and Ares, two space adventure games developed by Ambrosia, opened my eyes to the value of player-driven narratives and content. Through these two games, I discovered how players could be empowered to create their own unique and lasting player experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2011, I received an opportunity that would change my life when Meteor Entertainment, the publishers of HAWKEN, discovered a YouTube video I had made regarding the game. After winning a contest and meeting the HAWKEN Team at PAX East, they graciously offered me a position at Meteor Entertainment. A short time later I relocated to Seattle to begin my career. It was there I learned the value of customer satisfaction and customer retention, and eventually found myself in a Community Manager position.
