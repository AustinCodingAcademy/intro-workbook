    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <section>

        <p>
          I'm a 33 year old Scorpio. I was born in Carlsbad, NM and raised in Phoenix, AZ. I spent my early twenties in Chicago and moved to Austin in Feb 2006. I don't think I would ever live anywhere else. I've surrounded myself with like-minded people who keep me entertained and often drunk. I've worked many odd jobs and I've worked every position in the service industry from manager to door person. I'm currently taking a course at ACA to learn to code as I am ready for a career change.
