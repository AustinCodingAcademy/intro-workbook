    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Dr.Laura was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. She completed her medical degree at the University of Maryland School of
      Medicine in 2010 and her residency training in neurosurgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 2014.
      Following her residency, she quickly discovered her curiosity for thinking outside the box with neurosurgery.
      After successfully transplanting her dogs brain in her sisters cranium she decided to go in to private practice.
      While acquiring as many brains as she could, she now offers her services at her practice in Salem, Massachusetts.</p>
