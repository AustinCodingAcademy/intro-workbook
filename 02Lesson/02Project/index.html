                            <h1>Spiders Can "Hear" You from Across the Room!</h1>
                            <p>Scientists have discovered a new kind of spidey sense.

  We already knew that jumping spiders have exceptional vision. We knew that they are great at perceiving vibrations. We even knew that they can "hear" at extremely close range.

  But in research published in Current Biology, researchers at Cornell University found that a common species of jumping spider called Phidippus audax can actually hear from much farther away than we thought â€” at distances of 10 feet away, or more.

  "I've worked with these animals for a long time now and all of a sudden you realize that their world is completely different from what you thought," Paul Shamble, a fellow at Harvard and co-first author of the study, tells The Two-Way. "You thought they were just these little creatures of vibration and vision, and now all of a sudden you realize that they can hear, too."</p>
