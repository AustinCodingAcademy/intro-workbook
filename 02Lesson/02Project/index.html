                    A man is born he's a man of means. Then along come two they got nothin' but their jeans. The first mate and his Skipper too will do their very best to make the others comfortable in their tropic island nest. Love exciting and new. Come aboard were expecting
                    you. Love life's sweetest reward Let it flow it floats back to you. Come and dance on our floor. Take a step that is new. We've a loveable space that needs your face threes company too. Believe it or not I'm walking on air. I never
                    thought I could feel so free. Flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could it be? Believe it or not its just me. So get a witch's shawl on a broomstick you can crawl on. Were gonna pay a call on the Addams Family.</p>

                    Said Californ'y is the place you ought to be So they loaded up the truck and moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimmin' pools movie stars. It's time to put on makeup. It's time to dress up right. It's time to raise the curtain on the Muppet Show tonight.
                    Well we're movin' on up to the east side to a deluxe apartment in the sky. And you know where you were then. Girls were girls and men were men. Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again." Michael Knight a young loner on a
                    crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law. Just two good ol' boys Wouldn't change if they could. Fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood.</p>

                <p>Well we're movin' on up to the east side to a deluxe apartment in the sky. we might as well say... Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor. Here's the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely
                    girls.

                <p>Well we're movin' on up to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. But they got diff'rent strokes. It takes diff'rent strokes - it takes diff'rent strokes to move the world. Then one day he was shootin' at some food and up through
                    the ground came a bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Its mission - to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before. And if you threw a party - invited everyone you knew.
                    You would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say thank you for being a friend. No phone no lights no motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe it's primitive as can be. I have always wanted
                    to have a neighbor just like you. I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you. Then one day he was shootin' at some food and up through the ground came a bubblin' crude. Oil that is.</p>

                <p>Doin' it our way. There's nothing we wont try. Never heard the word impossible. This time there's no stopping us. Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Straightnin' the curves. Flatnin' the hills
                    Someday the mountain might get â€˜em but the law never will. Were gonna do it. Give us any chance well take it. Give us any rule we'll break it. We're gonna make our dreams come true. So lets make the most of this beautiful day. Since
                    we're together. All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls. Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. What might be right for you may not be right for some. They call him Flipper Flipper faster
                    than lightning. No one you see is smarter than he.</p>
