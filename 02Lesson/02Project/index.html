            A North Dakota judge today refused to authorize riot charges against award-winning journalist
            Amy Goodman for her reporting on an attack against Native American-led anti-pipeline protesters.

            “This is a complete vindication of my right as a journalist to cover the attack on the protesters,
            and of the public’s right to know what is happening with the Dakota Access pipeline,” said Goodman.
            "We will continue to report on this epic struggle of Native Americans and their non-Native allies
            taking on the fossil fuel industry and an increasingly militarized police in this time when climate
            change threatens the planet."
