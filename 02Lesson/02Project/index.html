            UFO Expert Found Dead
          </h4>
          <p>
            A conspiracy theorist has been found dead in Poland — just days after he texted his mom instructing her to “investigate” should anything happen to him. Max Spiers, a 39-year-old father of two, was found dead on a sofa in Poland, where he had gone to give a talk about conspiracy theories and UFOs.
