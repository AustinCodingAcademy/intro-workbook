            <h3>Scientists Accidently Discover Efficient Process to Turn CO2 into Ethanol</h3>
            <p>
                Scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have discovered a chemical reaction toturn CO2 into ethanol, potentially creating a new technology to help avert climate change. Their findings were published in the journal ChemistrySelect.

            <p>
                The researchers were attempting to find a series of chemical reactions that could turn CO2 into a useful fuel, when they realized the first step in their process managed to do it all by itself. The reaction turns CO2 into ethanol, which could in turn
                be used to power generators and vehicles...

            <h3>Clark Kent, Unethical Sports Writer?</h3>
            <h4>“You’re a reporter, not a detective,” Perry White to Clark Kent.</h4>
            <p>The month of March madness seems an odd season to be writing about football, but here goes — with a tale that demonstrates that there were sometimes shades of gray in the heroism of radio’s newspaper heroes. Before it’s over, the world’s favorite
                mild-mannered reporter has assaulted two innocent men, kidnapped one of them, burglarized a safe, and run from police. Maybe the authors of this September and October 1941 storyline hadn’t refined their book of superhero ethics yet — or
                absorbed the finer points of impartial journalism. The 15-episode story “Metropolis Football Team Poisoned” starts with Clark Kent announcing to Lois Lane that he’ll be covering a Metropolis U vs. State U game. He mentions that he doesn’t
                think State has a chance, but bases that on the Metropolis’ team’s perfect record... con't reading

            <h3>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has taken $424m (£300m) at the box office worldwide in its first five days despite poor reviews.</h3>
            <p>The global total - the fourth-highest ever - included $170.1m in the United States, a record for a March debut and the sixth-highest US opening weekend. Dawn of Justice took £15.5m in the UK - also a record for March. The film bringing the
                two superheroes together for the first time is a welcome success for Warner Bros. The studio has been hit by a series of expensive failures such as Jupiter Ascending and Pan in recent months. The DC Comics adaptation, which cost more than
                $250m to make, was Warner Bros' second-highest international opening after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The BBC's Mark Kermode described it as a "crushing disappointment", while Kate Muir wrote in The Times: "This superhero-smorgasbord
                melts into an electric soup of CGI."</p>
