        <h2>Trump Ditches Prompters, Continues Defense at NC Rally</h2>

        <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Less than halfway through Donald Trump's remarks, his Teleprompters had been dismantled. It was Trump himself who did it.

The GOP nominee admitted about 20 minutes into his speech that the Teleprompters he once spoke so harshly of against weren't working. "Get these out of here," he decided before unsurprisingly adding: "I like it better without the Teleprompters." Trump then physically shook one of the stands himself, knocking the glass panel out of the top of it. Moments later, he rid himself of the other one.

The shackles were literally off. "It's sort of cooler without" the prompters, Trump said in a slightly questioning tone. Shouts of "yes" and applause rang out from his supporters.

Trump retold advice he'd been given by past and current advisors that now that he was in the general election he should be using prompters.

"Why should I when they don't work?" as if finally finding an excuse to bail on the habit he'd been forced by those around him to accept.

Moments later, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, one of the advisers behind the push to be more presidential during the general, told NBC News that despite the downing of the prompters "at least he's still out with voters." She declined to answer questions about the multiple sexual assault allegations leveled against her candidate who was speaking on the stage.

Before Trump took the stage, his campaign offered the New York Post an exclusive interview with a man claiming to have been on an early 1980s flight with one of the women who has accused Trump, and he told the paper no assault occurred — citing his "good photographic memory." </p>
