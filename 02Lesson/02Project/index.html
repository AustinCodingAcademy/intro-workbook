  <p>Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, has just been cut off from all internet access by the country of Ecuador.  Assange has sought asylum in Ecudador since 2006, and has devoted his time to exposing private information for public good.  Most notably, Assange has published leaked documents from the DNC and Hillary Clinton's private email server, which the FBI could not hack.  It comes as no surprise that the provacteur has now effectively been cut off from all internet access.  There is much speculation as to who demanded that he no longer have internet access, but to many, the answer is clear.</p>
