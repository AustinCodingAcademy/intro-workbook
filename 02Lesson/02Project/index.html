                    <p>A Toronto court will hear arguments on an attempt to bar the Cleveland Indians from using their team name and logo in Ontario. The legal challenge by indigenous activist Douglas Cardinal comes on the same day the baseball team takes
                        on the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series in Toronto. Cardinal's lawyers will ask the court Monday to bar the usage of the name and logo by the team, Major League Baseball and Toronto team owner
                        Rogers Communications, which is broadcasting the game in Canada. Cardinal says they shouldn't be allowed to wear their regular jerseys, the logo shouldn't be broadcast and the team should be referred to as ''the Cleveland team.</p>

                    <p>Career Point College students and staff were shocked Sunday evening by the emails and push alerts received informing them that their school has closed its doors permanently.In the notice of closure sent to all members of the campus
                        it states the management team discovered three long-term employees had collaborated to violate rules related to student aid funds. It states that after an investigation, the president self-reported the inappropriate activity to
                        the Department of Education and provided a plan to repay the funds taken. “Even though no money was stolen, and even though the College had self-report the violation and agreed to repay all inappropriately received funds, the plan
                        was not accepted,” the notice said.

            <h2>Obama administration annual budget is declining</h2>
            <article>
                <div id=Economy </div>
                    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/718494029021728768/2ENsRPrk.jpg" alt="Obama picture">
                    <p>
                        The Obama administration confirmed on Friday that a six-year run of declining annual budget deficits had halted: The shortfall for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $587 billion, an increase over last year in dollars and as a percentage of the economy.
                        The uptick, which had been projected last winter by government analysts, largely reflected the revenue loss from expiring tax breaks for businesses and individuals that Congress extended in December. President Obama had proposed
                        to pair the tax cuts with some tax increases on wealthy Americans, to avoid adding to the deficit, but Congress refused. The $587 billion deficit for fiscal year 2016 is equivalent to 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product,
                        the measure of the overall output of the economy. The previous year's deficit was $438 billion, or 2.5 percent of G.D.P. — a reduction of three-quarters from the level amid the recession at the end of the George W. Bush administration.
