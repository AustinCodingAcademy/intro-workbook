<p>This is a paragraph that contains <span class="first">several span tags</span>. I'd like to style these span tags across my <span>entire site at once</span>, to establish a default  site-wide format for them. The most efficient selector for this would be the <span>element selector</span>, as it will allow me to establish a base-line format for the span tag with a <span>low degree of specificity</span>. This means that the formatting will be controlled throughout the entire site with a single selector, and it will be <span>easy to overwrite in specific instances</span> where I want the styling to change.</p>

<h4>Targeting class attributes</h4>
<p>In this example I want to target specific class attribute values. Note how the styling is applied regardless of element type. <em class="highlight">Class selectors are also more specific than element selectors</em>, so they allow us to overwrite the more general styles of element selectors.</p>
<h4 class="highlight">Using class selectors</h4>
<p>They also allow us to target very specific locations or instances by simply applying a <strong class="highlight">class attribute</strong>. This is a great way to write styles for specific purposes with a single selector and then apply it whenever needed by adding the appropriate class attribute.</p>
<p>Care should be taken when using class selectors as overuse of them can bloat code and create stylesheets that are hard to maintain.</p>
