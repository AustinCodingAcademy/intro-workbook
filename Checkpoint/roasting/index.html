      <h1>The Coffee</h1>
      <h2>COFFEE: UNPLUGGED</h2>
      <p>Revisiting the craft of 19th century coffee roasters, we built a one-of-a-kind hearth, brick by brick, with no power cord or
        start button. It takes three people to custom hand-roast our coffee every day.</p>

        <h2>COFFEE BEANS</h2>
        <p>Our beans are the best of the best - Central and South America, Africa and Indonesia.
          <br>
          90% Fair Trade 100% Organic 100% Arabica
          <br>
          Zero Shelf Stock - All orders custom roasted and shipped.</p>

          <h2>TEXAS OAK</h2>
          <p>Our days begin with collecting, hand-splitting and stacking one of nature’s finest resources: Texas Oak.</p>

          <h2>FLAME</h2>
          <p>We tend the flames as the oak heats the firebrick to the perfect temperature. The difference between good coffee and
            great coffee is the control and consistency of the heat. Sight, sound and smell are the only tools employed to determine
            the readiness of both the fire we tend, and the coffee we roast.</p>

          <h2>RHYTHM</h2>
          <p>We use no gas or electricity in our commercial roaster. We employ a wood fire for heat and human
            ingenuity (muscle) to power our roaster- spinning the wheels at the perfect R.P.M.</p>

          <h2>PERFECTION</h2>
          <p>The wood, flames, firebrick and smoke do the heavy lifting, while we tend the fire and keep the beans in motion…The coffee
            tells US when it’s ready!</p>

          <h2>FAMILY</h2>
          <p>We drew upon our collective talents to build a roaster true to our heritage fired by our passion for great coffee. We strive
            to craft a coffee worthy of our efforts and a business that will keep us together for years to come.</p>
