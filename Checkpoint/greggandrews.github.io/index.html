      <h3>Real People - Authentic Music - No Labels</h3></div>

It all started during a month-long tour in England. During the long periods of downtime was during those down times that a seasoned musician and a world-class photographer spent time sharing life stories and including their disenchantment with the music industry establishment. John David Kent and Christopher Dunst quickly became good friends.  They realized that they had similar visions for a new approach to management, distribution and authentic music. They knew that this vision would need someone who had vast experience in music production. John knew immediately who the third person of the time could be - he's friend Will Loconto. These three came together to form Ternion Records - an Indie label focused on Triple-A and Electro-Americana artists. It's real people, making authentic music with no labels.

  <h3>Featured Artist - John David Kent</h3></div>

When you've been on a world tour and signed to a major record label at the age of 16, played on both Letterman and Conan, built your own studio, started your own record label, formed a new band whose first full-length record spawned three top 20 singles on the Texas charts and a hit video on CMT Pure Country, it's hard to imagine what kind of barometer John David Kent (JDK) uses to measure future success. "I want to continue to blur the lines of genres and spread my music across the world", says Kent. Ask five listeners to describe this band's musical genre and you are sure to get five different answers. A breath of fresh air in the music industry, John David Kent's music is "influenced by..." without "sounding just like...".
<br><br>
John David Kent released an EP in 2009 that evolved into John's first full-length record as a front man. Released on his independent label, Blackland/Roustabout Records, JDK's eponymous debut saw instant success. Propelled by three top 20 singles on the Texas Country chart, Runaway, Back To The Country, & My Girl (also a CMT Pure Country hit video), JDK has generated a following of thousands of listeners waiting to see what he will do with this momentum. Originally from Greenville, currently residing in the neighboring town of Celeste, and packing up for his future home in Spicewood, JDK is on the move in many ways.
<br><br>
So exactly how does John David Kent measure future success? With characteristic humility, Kent answers, "before I was in the music business, I was a music fan. I will continue to be one no matter where this leads". Perhaps College Station Radio DJ, Adam Drake, can help JDK see where his art is leading his listeners. "This music will take you on a ride; it's got everything from the fun and upbeat songs, to the stuff that just tears at your heart. The older I've gotten, the less time I have to hop in the truck and drive down to the beach. I love it when albums like this make me want to do just that". Whether opening for Merle Haggard or playing festivals in France this summer, it would appear that this band's road trip is just getting started.
