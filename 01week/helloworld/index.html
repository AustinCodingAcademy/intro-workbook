  <p>
    George has been an athlete his entire life. He grew up in New Jersey where he spent much of his youth on a bike doing tricks and then on to BMX racing. Once his local track closed he ventured onto football and track where he competed as a sprinter and consistently medaled in regional and state championships. It was during those years where he developed the mentality on how to get the most out of the body. He competed in college for a few years but then got introduced to mountain biking by a friend and he was hooked. He's been riding ever since. He honed his mountain biking chops in the super challenging  Adirondack mountain region. He's competed in XC racing, Enduro and Road Racing events.

    George's goals are to introduce more people to the incredible sport of mountain biking, help students be their absolute best "them" and to make sure kids are having the coolest time ever on a bike.
