                        I was born January 1st 2001 in roseville, CA.
                        My family moved up the west coast since my birth. 
                        From Roseville to Medford, OR; to Kent, WA; and finally to Seattle, WA.
                        When I was 13 I got my first job as a stock boy at my mom’s friends clinic.
                        After that I ran my own various businesses from yard work to running a convenience store out of my locker.
                        When I was 15 I started working with my dad painting houses and that is what I still do today.

                        I have always been interested in computers, both hardware and
                        software. My first computer was a broken laptop my mom handed
                        down to me. She didn’t think I could actually use it, but one
                        windows repair disk and a hdd replacement and it was good to go.
                        Since then I have been building my own computers and doing all
                        of the maintenance on them. I first got into CS when I 
                        enrolled in a Java course sophomore year of highschool. 
                        The intro class was full so I was thrown into AP. Computer
                        science fit like a glove and soon I was ahead of the class,
                        completing side projects, and using methods and libraries
                         we haven’t been taught to use.

                        Last year I moved to San Antonio and now I am finishing up
                        high school and should graduate before December. My plan is
                        to finish high asap, complete ACA full stack c#.net, and
                        work for my uncle at his communications company based in
                        Seattle.
