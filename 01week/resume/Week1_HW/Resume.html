      	  <h1>Summary</h1>
      	  <article>
        	I am a process oriented QA team player bringing nearly 10 years of increasingly responsible experience
            in product excellence at both Fortune 500 companies and growing startups. I am dedicated to using
            the best practices that I have learned to streamline QA activities and develop a synced operating
            rhythm with dev and product partners to build useable and highly functional applications. With a
            well- rounded background in hardware and software, I am able to offer expertise in how web and
            mobile applications will behave across multiple form factors. I have used this insight, coupled
            with leadership skills, to build QA teams from scratch. I am passionate about building strong
            relationships and developing unique processes that lead to improved communication and products
            of high quality and profitability.
