                   It seems you miraculously stumbled across my website. Of course there happened to be a reason to come across this domain, but
                   because there are so many variations/chances/encounters/events that lead you here, I can merely guess the causes of such previously said phenomena.
                   Thing is, and as hard as it is to believe, I'm not trying to be redundant here, so without further ado, allow me to introduce myself! <br></br>
                   My name is Ezra Effanga, and I'm a native-born Austinite with a slowly rising caffeine dependency, but that's a simple
                   consequence of being a barista! Programming is a field that (for the most part) I'm completely foriegn to, but the fact that
                   it not only provides an oppurtunity to unmask a creative outlet for myself, it's also a conveninently rising occupation in the job
                   market. Conclusions has always been awkward for me, so I guess I'll finish with both a personal and public affirmation:
                   Give me a few months to learn, and I will not dissapoint *nervous thumbs up*.

              I must admit that this will be the least impressive of my background, but it's a truth that I cannot deny.
              Besides the basic public education that one receives from elementary through highschool, I attended Austin community
              College to pursue a degree in computer engineering. Other than that, my "expansive" background is anything but.

                     orders, knowledge of the menu to provide information to both first time and seasoned (ba-dum-tss) customers, and
                     daily (minutely) cleaning procedures. Ah, and a smile, fake or not, can go a long way to help a customer through

            <ul>

              Yes, the very basics is what I know, but my general tenacity towards learning challenging concepts/languages
              is what guides me to learn them at quite a fast speed. Make no mistake, I'll learn 'em.
