       Inside Sales Associate
       <br/>
       Austin Homes Direct
       <br/>
       10/2016 - 02/2017
      </p>
      <p>
       I was offered the opportunity to join Austin Homes Direct with the
       promise of becoming an agent with the team once I got my Real Estate
       License. I started as an Inside Sales Associate in which I made cold
       calls to generate prospects for the agents I worked under. I was
       consistently the top producing ISA, exceeding the goals set before us.
       Unfortunately, they ended up downsizing and letting all the ISAs go.

      Voyage Solar Energy
      <br/>
      05/2016 - 10/2016
      </p>
      <p>
       My responsibilities included, using our sales process to create rapport
       with customers, informing them of the value of going solar, and
       "closing the deal" in the home or setting a future appointment with
       the customer. I was also responsible for communicating all necessary
       notes regarding the appointment with each customer and logging
       that into our CRM.

      02/2015 - 05/2016
      </p>
      <p>
       I started with Revolve Solar as a sales consultant but was promoted
       within 7 months. Within my first 7 months I achieved many top sales
       awards including the top salesman company wide in Q2. In my promotion,
       I was managing our entire Central Texas team, which consisted of 8-12
       sales consultants and a team of 3-6 canvassers. I was responsible for
       training my teams to sell and generate referrals, as well as creating
       projections and goals for the office, net-working throughout the city,
       setting up events for marketing purposes, and hiring/firing.
