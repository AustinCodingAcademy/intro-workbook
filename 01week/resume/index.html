      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p class="info">I am highly self-motivated when it comes to work and I take pride in getting quality work done efficiently. Previously, I have worked as an Administrative Assistant where most of the work was done independently. At Chick-fil-A I learned valuable customer service skills and how to effectively communicate with peers, managers and customers in high stress situations. I successfully trained several employees to become efficient at multitasking while building and maintaining a positive rapport with customers.</p>
