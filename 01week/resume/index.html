                        <p> <strong> SUCCESS MEANS MANY WONDERFUL</strong>. positive things. Success
means personal prosperity: a fine home, vacations, travel, new
things, fmandal security, giving your children maximum advantages.
Success means winning admiration, leadership, being
looked up to by people in your business and sodallife. Success
means freedom: freedom fium worries, fears, frustrations, and
failure. Success means self-respect, conrinually fmdirig more real
happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for
those who depend on you.
Success means winning.
Success~achievement~is the goal of life!
Every human being wants success. Everybody wants the
. best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys crawling, living in mediocrity.
No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go
that way.
Some of the most practical suq:ess-building wisdom is found
in that biblical quotation stating that faith can move mountains.
Believe, really believe, you can move a mountain, an~ you
can. Not many people believe that they can move mountains. So,
as a result, not many people do. </p>
