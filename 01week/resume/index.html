I have been told by others that I have a electrifying stage presence, and command of the stage and my instrument. I hold myself with the utmost professionalism in the studio and on the road.  I beleieve that the band needs to function as one unit in order to give a true performance. I will provide extreme dedication to any future tours, projects, and artists that may need my services.</p>
