      links on the page to open in a new window, using the 'target' attribute.
      You can still change INDIVIDUAL links to a different target to override
      the base target, if you want. I thought maybe .css could accomplish this,
      but this is a behavior, not a style.  -->

      <!-- Since my first name 'Seville' is also the name of a city in Spain
      and a model of Cadillac, I've used Microdata to identify me as a
      'person'. Since the entire resume page is about me (not just certain
      sections of the page), I've nested the entire <body> inside the <main>
      tag and assigned the attribute to <main>.
      Since i can't see this info on the page, how can I validate I added the
      Microdata correctly?-->
