      Here's where I'm supposed to tell you about myself, so here goes. I'm 24 years old, and I like longs walks to the fridge, and late nights with an immersive RPG. If I'm not engrossed in a particular RPG, you would probably find me picking at a guitar,
      or other typical 24 year old stuff, like taking garbage out, or playing with the pup.

          <p class="text-shadow">Coding is something thats always piqued my interest since I was young. Seeing what was able to be accomplished with java, htmk, css, etc. blew me away with the possibilities! Having a very active imagineation, thoughts , and ideas poured out, but
        i didn't know how to put those ideas into a tangible goal.
