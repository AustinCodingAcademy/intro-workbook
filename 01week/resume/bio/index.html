     Welcome To My Bio!
   </h1>
     <p>
     Here's where I'm supposed to tell you about myself, so here goes.
     I'm  24 years old, and I like longs walks to the fridge, and late nights with an immersive RPG.
     If I'm not engrossed in a particular RPG, you would probably find me picking at a guitar, or
     other typical 24 year old stuff, like taking garbage out, or playing with the pup.

    <p>Coding is something thats always piqued my interest since I was young.
       Seeing what was able to be accomplished with java, htmk, css, etc. blew
       me away with the possibilities! Having a very active imagineation, thoughts
     , and ideas poured out, but i didn't know how to put those ideas into a tangible goal.
