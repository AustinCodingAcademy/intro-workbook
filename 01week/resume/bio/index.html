      Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

Watch out. Squad at .06. I'm on it, Gold Leader. Good shot, Red Two. Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born.

It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge.

It's a trap
