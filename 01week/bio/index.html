    <h1>Greg Swan: The Story of a Candy Cartel</h1>
    <p>Greg Christopher Swan is one of the world’s most dangerous and wanted
      fugitives. He is responsible for trafficking more illegal and untaxed
      chocolate than any other candy cartel lord in human history.
    </p>
    <p>For Greg, it all started with a lemonade stand. At the age of nine,
      Greg setup a small lemonade stand on the corner of the quaint street he
      grew up on, nothing seemed out of the ordinary to passers by who paid a
      measly price for the taste of mediocre lemonade, however Greg got a taste
      of something much more gratifying than a fruity little drink- cold hard
      cash.
    </p>
    <p>One could call lemonade his gateway sweet. He quickly moved up through
      the ranks, selling gummies, licorice and caramels, however, nothing compared
      to the success he would find when he started selling chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>He quickly began selling mass quantities of untaxed and unregulated chocolate.
      By fifteen Greg was making hundreds of thousands a year from the production
      and distribution of illegal chocolate. At twenty one he had devised a full
      scale vertically integrated chocolate empire. He built coco plantations all
      over South America, smuggling it into the U.S in every possible way one could
      imagine, he would then refurnish it into various types of candy, hiding any
      traces of where it came from (he even made under the table deals with companies
      like Hershey and Nestle), and finally he would distribute it from a large
      network of warehouses all over the US. Chances are if you've had a chocolate
      bar in the past 8 years, Greg Swan had a hand in it.
    </p>
    <p>In 2014 Greg was said to be worth 2.7 billion dollars and with such a
      large paper trail, he had difficulty hiding it from the feds. They began
      to catch on. The FSSA (Federal Sugar and Sweets Administration) went on
      hundreds of orchestrated raids hoping to catch him in the act, however
      that day never came.
    </p>
    <p>Greg has now been MIA for the last two years, escaping any attempts by the
      FSSA to locate him. However he hasn’t been sleeping, his chocolate continues
      to show up all over the country. Underground, Greg Swan is still running his
      candy empire, raking in millions of U.S dollars from the black candy market.
      To him, it’s just like stealing candy from a baby.
