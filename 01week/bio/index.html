        <h3> About me </h3>
        <!--This Paragraph is about me!-->
        <p> I am a very motivated person.I have always had ondurationchange
          a great amount of energy that needs to be used. If I stay still,
          I tend to become anxious. 4 years ago I obtained a BFA in performane arts from Texas State University.
        Shortly after I moved to Austin and was tired of struggling as an artist and learned how to apply eyelash extensions
        and now that is my
      bread and butter.  Hopefully I will be able to code like a pro. With this I can become a developer and literally change the world one web page at a time.</p>
      <!-- This is why i want to become a developer!-->
<p> Why Do I want to become a developer?
  Knowing how to code can feed me for a lifetime. It is a very secure job. I also find programming very interesting. I feel power with being able to control things and create.
