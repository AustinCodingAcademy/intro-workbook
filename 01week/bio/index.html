   my bio-page!</p>

   <article class="bio">
     I was born in South Carolina but did most of my growing up in Massachusetts
     in a town called Haverhill, nestled in the banks of the mighty Merrimack
     river, an aging relic of the texitile hey-day's of the 70's and 80's but
     still trying to stay current, like that relative or friend who tries...but
     just doesn't get it.
     <p>I was into computers early, late 80's, early ninties.
     I remeber the internet when it was just message boards and ftp sites,
     and this still is just the beginning. <p>
      Then I started cooking and I loved it. After 9/11 the IT company I was
      working for went under and I decided to make cooking my career. One of
      benefits of the work is that you can easily travel. I've lived in Seattle,
      New Orleans, Charleston, SC, Boston. I got my B.A. from the New England
      Culinary Institute in Montepelier, Vermont which is also my last state
      of residence.
         </p>
        Now, after almost literally a lifetime, I think it might be fun to give
        computers another shot. See what it's like to work sitting down.
