    <h1>A bit about Stu.</h1>

    <p class="bio">
      I have had an interest in computers and coding since I was younger.
      My mother worked for HP, so I always had a computer in front of me
      to experiment with. While I've only dabbled in coding thus far,
      what little HTML I learned before is quickly coming back to me.
      I have a passion for learning, be it coding, languages, or how to
      better myself, I'm always excited to learn! I'm an avid gamer, and
      double-dog-dad.

      These are my dogs, Pi (left) and Churchill (right). Churchill likes
      to stare at my guests until they pet him, while Pi licks the air
      when she's excited. <strong>WHY WON'T THIS PICTURE COOPERATE</strong>
