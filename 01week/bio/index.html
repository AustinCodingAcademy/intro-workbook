      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I grew up in the (not so sparkling) city by the sea of Corpus Christi, TX. After high school, I attended Texas State University in San Marcos to pursue a BFA in Communication Design and naturally migrated to Austin after graduation.</p>
      <p>Shortly after relocation, I landed a job as a design intern at a one-man graphic design studio where I've worked ever since. I'm currently a full-time employee and we're still (mostly) a two person team.</p>
      <p>I have interests but they don't include writing about myself so we'll get to know eachother instead. :)</p>

      <h3>Why I am Learning how to Code</h3>
      <p>As a web designer, I'm learing how to code so that I can gain a better knowledge of how to create the most efficient and seamless user experiences possible. With this knowledge, I will be able to have better conversations with my devlopers to achieve
        this goal and even possibly pick up some of the front-end tasks myself ($$$).</p>
