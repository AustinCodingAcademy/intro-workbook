  <!-- Here is my paragraphs -->
  <div class="flex-grid-thirds">
    <div class="col">
     I grew up on the border of USA & Mexico in a small town called Eagle Pass, Texas. Crossing over to Mexico is a minute away from Eagle Pass and always a good idea.
</div>
    <div class="col">I was extremely active as a kiddo. I played soccer, basketball, ran track and cross-country, danced ballet, tap, flamenco. In High school I realized the need for arts in my community. I joined the theatre organization and loved how theatre made me feel at home. I had the opportunity to express myself and share art and read plays and attempt to share what it is to live life. I attended Texas State University of San Marcos from 2009-2013 where I obtained my bachelors in fine arts. Shortly after I moved to Austin Texas.</div>
    <div class="col">Being an actor in this day and age is challenging. I am forever grateful of the things I learned from my theatre degree. I continue to grow my art of acting by auditioning, reading plays and living in the moment.

    I plan to become a web developer because I love technology and the things we can achieve by creating in this way. Even though one might argue web developing is more logical, I believe I can still implement the things I have learned with the arts in making my web pages. I also believe that by developing I will always have a job since it is a stable career. In this way I use my left and right brain. Boom.</div>
