      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I grew up in the (not so sparkling) city by the sea that goes by the name of Corpus Christi, TX where I found myself restless of what the city and it's people had to offer. After high school, I attended Texas State University in San Marcos to pursue a degree in Communication Design and naturally migrated to Austin after graduation.</p>

      <p>A Belgian Quad by recipe, but aging it in spirits barrels garners its own category: Central Coast Quad. A beer formulated to sit on the sweeter and malty side so that we could utilize it for blending. Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico adds wonderful
        molasses flavors that are reminiscent of Belgian candi sugar. It has a full body and lush texture with barrel expression all over this beer: toasted oak, coconut, leather and cigar tobacco.</p>

      <h3>Why I am Learning how to Code</h3>
      <p>As a web designer, I'm learing how to code so that I can have better conversations with my developers. I want to have a sturdy knowledge of how to create the most seamless user experiences and I belive this starts with a design created with development in mind.</p>
