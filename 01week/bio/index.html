<!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <section>
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Hi, I’m a designer at IBM and a relatively new transplant to Texas. I call Austin my “layover” because I’m originally from California and I moved here from New York City. Besides working with an amazing team, one of the best things about being a designer is being able to problem solve. We work on a design system for a product called Bluemix. Together, we research, design, and build assets for other designers and engineers to consume.</p>

<!-- WHY I'M LEARNING TO CODE-->
    <section>
      <h3>Why I'm learning to code</h3>
      <p>My team consists of half designers and half engineers. We often pair and work closely together. Through these conversations I’ve started to learn about coding and find it interesting. I’d also like to bridge the knowledge gap between my designs and how it gets implemented into production-ready code. Being more fluent in coding means I’ll have more quality discussions with the front-end developers on my team. </p>
