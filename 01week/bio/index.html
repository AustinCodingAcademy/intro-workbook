    <h3>Why I am Learning to Code</h3>
    <p> Its an interesting time working in the world of finance. Large banking institutions typical roles are being threatened by small startups. The new realm of FinTech has taken the industry by storm over the past couple years. Now the typical industries within banking have to compete with these startup companies. This is certainly a great and exciting event to watch due to the fact this industry has been consolidated in the hands of a small multitude of large institutions for so long. Such startup companies range p2p lending, roboinvestor service apps, to the simple transfer of funds between users. The emergence between Finance and Technology is the future of this industry. Taking initiative to understand and learn the fundamentals of coding and how developers structure these new innovative platforms is precisely why I am here. <p>
