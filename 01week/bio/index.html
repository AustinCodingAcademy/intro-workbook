          <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in Texas. Spent most of my life in the Austin area. I am currently engaged and am getting married in Round Rock on Febuary 18th to the love of my life. <br/>
          I grew up around sports and played basketball into college where I attended Southwestern University. The work I have most enjoyed has come from small family businesses. I first began working for a small business with my parents who exposed me to the intricate workings of small business management. <br/>
      An ongoing passion of mine is seeking adventure. The sense of adventure has taken me all across the world from climbing Kilimanjaro to walking across Spain.    </p>

          <h3> Why I Am Learning How to Code:</h3>
          <p> Four years ago I had the opportunity working with a programmer to develop software from the ground up. Seeing the project from the beginnging to end and that evolution sparked a curiosity in me to combine my love of small business with coding. The ability of our programmer to create our vision from scratch and make it a reality opened up my eyes to a career path I had never considered.  </p>
