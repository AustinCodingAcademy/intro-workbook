    <h3>Why I am Learning How to Code:</h3>
    <p>
      I've always enjoyed building things and taking things apart.
      I considered learning programming in high school,
      but felt there wasn't a culture match so-to-speak.
      I thought I'd be meeting people like from the film "Hackers", a film I idolized because of the portrayal of
      rebellious, independently-minded hackers. 
      Instead my high school computer class was just a bunch of uptight, conservative nerd bro guys.
      When I grew older I realized you're never really going to be happy
      in a work environment unless you set your mind to being happy,
      so I got over that and decided to learn anyway.
      I'm here now because I've tried to learn on my own,
      but always struggled to finish courses once they got harder.
      I am looking for mentorship.
