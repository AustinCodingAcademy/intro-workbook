      <p>Born in San Antonio, Texas. I am a 29 year old currently studying full stack web development at the, Austin Code Academy. I have also invested my own time and money in studying other languages such as python, ruby, javascript, and shell script.</p>
      <p>I am a person of few words, but once I get comfortable I can be very socialable and work hard to complete tasks in an efficiant manner.
        <p>Some of my hobbies are playing drums, riding super sport motorcycles , learning to code, and cooking. I am also a ASE certified automotive technician who can't wait to never have to pick up a tool again to make money
