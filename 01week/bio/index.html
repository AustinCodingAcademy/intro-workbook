                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>My name is Cristian Castaneda. I am 22 year old and I was born in Oakland, CA. I spent a portion of my childhood in a very dangerous neighborhood in East Oakland. Constant drug and violence was a daily occurrence in and around thestreets
                        I walked and played along. My mother decided to move to give us a better life and oppurtunity. From there on I moved and traveled a lot. I moved to central California (the Valley) to Southern California. After that I moveto Arkansas
                        in a little town called El Dorado where my family opened a business. After about a year we decided to move to Texas, in another little town called Nacogdoches. I spent the majority of my teen life in a high school called Nacogdoches
                        High School. I graduated high school in the year of 2012. From there I moved to California to attend the International Culinary Center to study the Culinary Arts. I graduated with a Grand diploma in Culinary Arts. I then decided
                        to move back to Texas, where I now reside in Austin. I currently work at Franklin Barbecue making the best brisket in Texas.</p>

                    <h3>Why Am I Learning to Code</h3>
                    <p>I want to use my own mind, my imagination, and my creativity to create new things. I've always had a passion for solving new ideas. I want to challenge my self and imerse myself in a new career that can hopefully one day change my
                        future. I believe coding is the future and I am ready for the future.</p>
