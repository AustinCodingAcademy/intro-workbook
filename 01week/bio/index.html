          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Born in Mexico and raised in Amarillo, I moved to Austin about three years ago. During the day I teach 4th graders a thing or two about math and science. This is the first year I've taught 4th grade and my previous years of teaching have all been in 3rd grade.</p>
          <p>In my early years I played football in middle school and soccer in high school. During college I played in an indoor soccer team. Most tiring sport <em>ever!</em> My first job ever was with my uncle working out of his Mexican food truck back home in Amarillo. Best perk: tacos all day.</p>
          <p>During my freetime, I like to go hiking and swimming. I enjoy travelling but don't get to travel often. I also enjoy going to concerts and watching local bands perform at small venues.</p>

          <h3>Why I am Learning to Code</h3>
          <p>I am learning to code because technology and programming are the future. From job automation to Alexa turning your lights off at home, its all accomplished because of code. While I enjoy teaching, unless I want to move to administration, there isn't anywhere to move up on the ladder. With programming, I would hope to be able to develop apps or programs that could be used for educational purposes.</p>
