    <h1>The Biography of J.D. Rowlett</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p1>I was born and raised in Santa Clara, California, in 1985. Santa Clara is located in the heart of Silicon Valley and I grew up at a time when tech was making huge advances with the dawn of the internet. My parents' house was just a couple of blocksfrom the headquarters of Hewlett Packard and I remember riding my bike through the company's tree-covered parking lots.</p1>
    <br></br>

    <p2>My parents are wonderful people, always patient with me and caring for me in every way. I am an only child but I was blessed to always have friends around. At church, at school, in the Boy Scouts and many other places and periods in my life I was always blessed to have friends and acquaintances. I was never a great athlete but I always tried my best in sports whether it was soccer, baseball or football, I always tried to do the best I could with the abilities I have. That said, I was never going to see a career in the NBA. (I'm just fine with that!) I am a huge fan of the San Jose Sharks and San Francisco Giants.</p2>
    <br></br>

    <p3>I always did better with English and History in school than I did with math or science. I was always attracted to the 'arts'; whether it was music or classic literature. I used to make movies in high school about the various English lit books we would read such as Great Expectations or To Kill a Mockingbird. I was blessed to be able to travel in school as well. I went on literary tours to places such as Washington DC, Boston, New York and London. I cherished these trips and have made wonderful memories in my high school years.</p3>

    <p4>I went to Florida College in Tampa, Florida, where I met even more friends and fell in love with that state. I love the beaches, golf courses and entertainment that is there. Florida is one of my favorite states! I transferred to Western Kentucky University and graduated there with a degree in Communications. After college I moved back to California and worked at various places including Apple Retail and as a contractor for Google. I met my wife-to-be in the summer of 2014 and we were married in the fall 2015 after I moved to where she was at, Austin, Texas. I am currently working for her father's business here and I am looking to make a change in careers: to be an entrepreneur!
  <br></br>
    I love the idea of running my own business. I love Austin a lot and have gotten to enjoy many of its unique experiences it has to offer. I row crew with the Austin Rowing Club downtown each week and I enjoy the music and arts scene that is here as well. ACA has offered me a lot as well and I am glad to be learning to code!</p4>
