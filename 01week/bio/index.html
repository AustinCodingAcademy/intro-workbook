        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Born in Mexico and raised in Amarillo, I moved to Austin about three years ago. During the day I teach 4th graders a thing or two about math and science. This is the first year I've taught 4th grade and my previous years of teaching have all been in 3rd grade.</p>
        <p>During my freetime, I like to go hiking in the beautiful greenbelts that Central Texas has to offer.</p>
