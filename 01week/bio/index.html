                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>Originally from Lancaster, PA I moved to Austin in 2015 to chase the tech industry and grow my career. I graduated from Penn State University with a degree in Marketing. I worked my way through college in various jobs but mostly for Northwestern Mutual as an associate financial representative. I knew that the buttoned-up financial industry wasn't where I would be forever and as soon as I graduated I landed a job as a digital marketer, thus beginning my career in the tech industry.</p>
                        <p> Currently I work as a digital marketing consultant as well as an eCommerce project manager. </p>
                        <p>I spend my free time with my husband, Peter, our 2 house bunnies, 1 dog, and foster dogs. We enjoy working out in our garage gym, working on our personal websites and drinking a glass of wine (or three.)</p>

                        <h3>Why I am Learning to Code</h3>
                        <p>Working as a digital marketer allows me to flex some technical skills including minor CSS and HTML edits, and I have enjoyed it from the start. I want to redesign and re-launch my personal website using my new skills. I also plan to use coding skills as a project manager for eCommerce websites as I manage a team of highly skilled programmers. I look forward to being able to get my handds dirty in the code when we need extra help on the projects I manage.</p>
                        <p>Learning to code is something that I am proud of and intend to continue to work on my skills for a long time to come. </p>
