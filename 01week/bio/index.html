        A Little About Nancy
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in <strong>Monterrey, Mexico</strong>, just a
        little south from my current hometown, <strong>Austin, Texas</strong>.
        I moved to the United States almost seven years ago. I lived in <strong>
        Dallas</strong> for a year, while I finished my Associate's in Culinary
        Arts at <em>Le Cordon Bleu</em>. The following year, I moved to <strong>
        Orlando, FL</strong> to finish my professional externship at <strong>Walt
        Disney World</strong>. I continued to live there for the next 5 years
        until moving back to Texas sounded like a good idea. However, this time,
        I ended up in Austin. I am currently the lead pastry chef at Westminster
        Manor, an upscale retirement community.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What did I do in Orlando?
      </h2>
      <p>
        After finishing my culinary externship, I was offered a full-time
        position at <strong>Disney World</strong>. I mainly focused on baking and
        pastry, having the opportunity to work in a few locations around the resort.
        After a few years with the company, I joined the <strong>Four Seasons</strong>
        team in their baking/pastry department.
        At the same time, I collaborated with <strong>Corazon Communications</strong>
        and <strong>Make A Wish</strong> in order to provide translating services
        to <strong>Make A Wish Families</strong> around Orlando's
        most popular theme parks.

      <h2>
        So why do I want to code?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Well, let's just say that back when I was around fourteen years old, I
        spent a lot of time at a <em><a href="http://www.deckleswood.com" target="_blank">
        Harry Potter RPG site</a></em>. I always wanted to do
        much more for the site like other people did and even had my "own website"
        that I had attempted to create with super bacic HTML. I even pretended
        I knew how to use Photoshop and had an image map as navigation bar.
        Unfortunately, I watched too much
        <em><a href="http://www.bravotv.com/top-chef" target="_blank">Top Chef </a></em>
        afterwards and pursued a career in the culinary industry. But here I am,
        wanting to learn how to code once again!
