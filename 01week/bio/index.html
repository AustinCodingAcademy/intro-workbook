          <h3> About me </h3>
          <!-- This Paragraph is about me! -->
          <p> I am a very motivated person.I have always had ondurationchange a great amount of energy that needs to be used. If I stay still, I tend to become anxious. 4 years ago I obtained a BFA in performane arts from Texas State University. Shortly after
              I moved to Austin and was tired of struggling as an artist and learned how to apply eyelash extensions and now that is my bread and butter. Hopefully I will be able to code like a pro. With this I can become a developer and literally change
              the world one web page at a time.</p>
          <!-- This is why i want to become a developer!-->
          <p> Why Do I want to become a developer? Knowing how to code can feed me for a lifetime. It is a very secure job. I also find programming very interesting. I feel power with being able to control things and create.
            Job security is everything to me. I know that by becoming a web development master,I will always have a job.
