     <p>I was born in South Carolina but did most of my growing up in Massachusetts
       in a town called Haverhill, nestled in the banks of the mighty Merrimack
       river, an aging relic of the textile hey-day's of the 70's and 80's but
       still trying to stay current, like that relative or friend who tries...but
       just doesn't get it.</p>
       <p>I was into computers early, late 80's, early ninties.
        I remember the internet when it was just message boards and ftp sites,
        and this still is just the beginning.</p>
        <p>Then I started cooking and I loved it. After 9/11 the IT company I was
        working for went under and I decided to make cooking my career. One of
        benefits of the work is that you can easily travel. I've lived in Seattle,
        New Orleans, Charleston, SC, Boston. I got my B.A. from the New England
        Culinary Institute in Montepelier, Vermont which is also my last state
        of residence.
         </p>
        <p>Now, after almost literally a lifetime, I think it might be fun to give
        computers another shot. See what it's like to work sitting down.
        </p>
