    <h3>Trucks</h3>
    <p>This is the middle ground way but also the most dangerous way to get out of the country. The reasons being possible check point stops and being crammed in with 15 other families in a giant metal box going on bumpy roads.</p>

    <h3>Planes</h3>
    <p>This is the most expensive way but also the fastest, most secure, and covert. You might even get a seat, it'll probably be some cardboard box but hey that's better than nothing. In the early days of the outflux of people you probably won't be shot down, so get onboard today!</p>

    <h3>Trains</h3>
    <p>This is the cheapest way to travel, although who actually uses them anymore? Anyway the upside is the low price and long miles between stops allowing more distance to be covered but they don't leave the country so eventually you will have to find another way out.</p>
