            We have a blog because its 2002. no one wants to read a blog anymore. There are better ways to get your news and information than on a blog. if a friend asked me if I want to read their blog I would laugh uncontrollably in their face.

            I had a friend named Tushar. He was from Bombay born and raised.He would get so angry when people would call it Mumbai. he would go on and on about how it was Bombay and should stay that way. I kind of get it. Pluto is still a planet for me.
