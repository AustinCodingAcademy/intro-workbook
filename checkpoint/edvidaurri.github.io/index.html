        <h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p class="aboutme">Sylvia Vidaurri was born and raised in Austin. She believes she might be one of the luckiest person’s alive in Austin to have the true Austinite Designation. She has been married to a wonderful man, Eddie, since 1981 and they have two adult children
          fulfilling their dreams.</p>

        <p class="aboutme">Sylvia is an owner and full-time real estate broker associate with Tetra Properties, Inc., which specializes in real estate sales located in Central Texas. Helping her clients acquire a home or desired piece of real estate in all the neighboring
          communities of Austin is what she finds enjoyment in. She has sold many homes, land and commercial real estate in this beautiful part of Central Texas.</p>

        <p class="aboutme">She started her real estate career in 2000. Prior to selling real estate, Sylvia was a licensed court reporter in Texas. She practiced court reporting for over 15 years and traveled Texas and other states that did not have licensed court reporters
          in the ‘80s and ‘90s. After a grease fire injury, which left both hands with second and third degree burns in the late ‘90s, she decided to move forward into a totally new direction… this was real estate. In 2000 she obtained her real estate
          license. What an opportunity the grease fire ultimately became.</p>
        <p class="aboutme">Her commitment to her clients’ desires and positive attitude moves her clients toward their real estate goals. She is a hands-on person. You will always find her working on her clients’ behalf, whether selling or buying real estate.</p>
        <p class="aboutme"><em><strong>“I am personally committed to the success of each of my clients. Your goal is my goal. Open communication mixed with honesty and respect always builds a bond of trust for a successful transaction. Moving forward together.”
      Sylvia M. Vidaurri</em></strong>
