            <p><strong>Acquired Brain Injury (ABI)</strong> is defined as an injury to the brain which is not hereditary, congenital or degenerative that has occurred after birth.</p>
            <p><strong>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</strong> is defined as an insult to the brain, not of degenerative or congenital nature, caused by an external physical force that may produce a diminished or altered state of consciousness, which results
              in an impairment of cognitive abilities or physical functioning.</p>
            <p>Following a brain injury and the initial phases of acute medical care, many survivors and families are left without a meaningful support system or viable resources. All too often financial resources are exhausted and family members must make
              extreme sacrifices or settle for less than adequate housing and care to make ends meet.An acquired or traumatic brain injury can result in a myriad of long-term physical and cognitive deficits requiring extended rehabilitation and other
              specialized services tailored to the individual and family. Just as every human is a unique individual, each brain injury survivor is uniquely affected by their injury.To best meet the needs of a person who sustained a brain injury one should
              not only determine how the injury has affected the survivor, but also determine the impact on each family member and other loved ones.</p>
            <p>Advanced medical technology coupled with improved service delivery has led to an increase in the brain injury survival rate nationwide.Unfortunately the funding ratio for brain injury services has not kept pace with the increased need for
              services resulting in significant gaps in the continuity of care being currently provided statewide.We hope that the information provided below will help educate and assist the brain injury survivor, family member and caregiver as one navigates
              their way thru an ever challenging journey.</p>

            Taking care of yourself is as important as taking care of your loved one who sustained a traumatic brain injury.Respite care or periodic breaks are essential for maintaining one’s mental and physical health.If short term respite care is not available
            in your community, explore potential alternatives.These may include relatives, friends or close associates.If your city has a “Mayor’s Committee for People with Disabilities”, find out if they are involved with a respite care program. Partnering
            with other families or networking with local religious groups to help facilitate the formation of a Respite Care Program is another alternative. Local “Adult Day Care Centers” may also be available for respite opportunities.Taking care of
            yourself includes learning to relax and participating in entertaining or relaxing events.Implement these in your daily routine. Implementing a daily exercise routine may also prove beneficial. A healthy diet, a structured routine and good
            sleep habits should also prove helpful for both the brain injury survivor and caregiver.

              Families often exert a considerable amount of time and energy locating an appropriate post acute brain injury program, but insufficient attention is devoted to what will happen once their loved one is discharged from a brain injury rehabilitation program.Families
              should explore exactly what resources will be needed following a projected discharge and more importantly where and how they can be secured. The following are examples of issues that should be addressed:</span>

              <p>Most parents will find that addressing the above issues sooner rather than latter will provide a sense of security for both their loved one and themselves.Otherwise inevitably the issues will emerge and require special attention. In addition
                the above issues will eventually emerge as parental longevity becomes an issue of concern.By openly discussing the specific long term needs of a brain injury survivor; one can better prepare for meeting those needs after their loved one
                leaves a brain injury rehabilitation program. In meeting these long term needs a family will need to establish a viable network of support utilizing resources provided by the facility staff/program, the state rehabilitation agency, existing
                community resources, friends and other loved ones. In similar support of this concept many Indian cultures understood, “It takes a village to raise a child,” or within our context, “It takes a community to provide the services needed by
                a brain injury survivor.”

                If an individual is being treated by more than one doctor, it is essential that all information involving medical treatment, medical recommendations and prescribed medications be shared with each treating doctor in a timely manner. This includes the use
                of over the counter medications. Also, each doctor should be informed whenever there are changes made involving one’s medical treatment or changes in medication. Encouraging a dialogue between each treating doctor is highly recommended
                and could prevent a severe complication from emerging.A person should never START or STOP taking a prescribed medication without first consulting with their doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>The Primary Care Physician:</em></strong>In most cases, an individual’s Primary Care Physician will oversee the majority of medical care needed by a brain injury survivor when residing in the community. In most cases a Doctor’s
                  Order will be required to secure the services of a Medical Specialist or Therapist.It is recommended to select a Primary Care Physician with experience treating brain injury to help facilitate better medical care.Upon the onset of a
                  traumatic brain injury, a doctor may place an individual on an anti-convulsant as a precautionary measure to help prevent the onset of a possible seizure.If an individual has not experienced any seizure-like behavior over an extended
                  period of time, then consult with your doctor to determine if the need still exists to continue the seizure medication. Individuals requiring the continued use of any medication over a period of time should maintain routine contact with
                  their Primary Care Physician. If taking a pain medication for an extended period of time your Primary Care Physician may want to refer the individual to a pain management specialist or clinic for an evaluation and/or possible alternative
                  treatment recommendations.</p>
                <p><strong><em>The Neurologist:</em></strong>; Most people will routinely require follow-up by a Neurologist following a traumatic brain injury. Once medically stable over sight by your Neurologist will likely be gradually reduced.</p>
                <p><strong><em>The Neuropsychologist:</em></strong>The general rule of thumb is to have an updated Neuropsychological Evaluation conducted once every one to two years while an individual is involved in ongoing rehabilitation.The brain injury
                  survivor and family members should be provided a thorough overview of the evaluation results. Loved ones should assertively advocate for any service or therapy being recommended by the Neuropsychologist.Any Neuropsychological Evaluation
                  over three years old may be deemed outdated by a medical professional.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Cognitive Therapist:</em></strong> A Cognitive Therapist will often work with an individual who has sustained a traumatic brain injury with the primary focus on improving one’s executive functioning skills and help develop
                  effective compensatory strategies.Therapy goals may include (but not limited to) helping improve one’s attention span, judgment, problem solving skills, decision making skills, organizational skills, emotional control, social skills,
                  initiation, time management skills, memory recall and awareness of deficits.Areas of focus may very easily overlap with other treatment disciplines.Treatment objectives should be documented utilizing observable, measurable terms. Prior
                  to initiation of services, each treatment objective should be explained to the survivor of a traumatic brain injury using clearly understood terms in order to promote full comprehension of the expected outcome.Cognitive therapy is quite
                  diverse and may promote the re-learning of a skill, modifying or adjusting a previous skill level, or learning compensatory strategies to help with one’s adjustment.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Outpatient Therapy:</em></strong>If Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy or Occupational Therapy is needed one should explore the various options provided within your community.Carefully review all fees and payment structures in
                  advance and request this information be placed in writing.Try to obtain services from therapists experienced in working with traumatic brain injury. Therapy may also include exercise or training that can be conducted in one’s home environment
                  (often called indirect therapy).In addition home modifications may be recommended to promote one’s level of independence or minimize levels of interference.All home therapy and assistive devices should be periodically evaluated and revised
                  if needed.</p>

                Sources for funding health care services may include private insurance, VA Program, HHSC, Texas Worker’s Compensation, Texas Crime Victims Compensation Fund, Trust Funds, Texas Workforce Commission, Protective Services Division, Medicaid, Medicare or
                private pay.If these options do not exist, then one may qualify for indigent medical care from your local medical assistance program.The quality of care provided by the latter is often equivalent to those found in most medical settings.One
                will find diversity within the scope of care and associated co-pay requirements within each program so it is important for an individual to carefully explore these factors involving each care provider. Psychiatric services and medication
                therapy may be available at your local mental health community clinic for qualifying individuals.Many of the larger cities in Texas have “Independent Living Centers,” which provide a wealth of resources, information and referral services
                and possible case management services to assist an individual in obtaining available community resources. As the type of services and qualifying standards change, it is best to contact both your local and state resource offices to best
                determine existing program availability.Most program services in Texas are listed with HHSC – just dial 2-1-1 and then specify what type of resource you are seeking. For a free Brain Injury Resource Guide which is routinely updated with
                pertinent brain injury programs and services please contact Chip Howe by dialing (512) 443-5777.
