 7. Administering your medication:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> An individual’s ability to administer their own medication should be determined by the physician prescribing the medication.Monitoring procedures should be provided if an individual is not capable of properly self-medicating.All medications should be stored at room temperature in a secured, locked location when not in use.If an individual is treated by more than one doctor then it is very important that each doctor develops a routine dialogue with each other to review continuity of care and use of prescriptive medications.In addition, each doctor should be made aware of any over the counter (OTC) medication an individual is utilizing.Excluding the use of PRN’s, if a person takes more than one medication a day or takes medication at different times of the day it is highly recommended that these medications be set up in a weekly pill box storage container.One can find these plastic pill box containers in most pharmacies or large retail stores.Select a pill box container that best meets your needs.Example: if you take a medications four times a day (QID) then select a container with four compartments for each day (28 total slots).By using a pill box container one can preset their medications for a week at a time, allows for easy monitoring by others if needed and more importantly serves a noticeable reminder if you are unsure if you had taken a medication or not.If a person forgets to take a medication then doubling the dose is never recommended.Always consult with your doctor or pharmacists if a medication error has occurred.If you or unable to reach your doctor or a pharmacist, then call your nearest hospital emergency room (ER) and ask for advice. Be on the safe side and make that call.Some medications require routine blood level checks and these checks are only requested if a significant need exists to do so. Be aware of any potential adverse side effect whenever a medication dose is changed or a new medication is started. The most common adverse side effects regarding the use of medication includes shaking or twitching, impaired speech or mobility, headaches, a rash, increased heart beat or sweating, or any unusual or atypical type behavior. Immediately report any of the previously listed observed conditions to your prescribing doctor or medical professional. In conclusion the following is always worth repeating: never START or STOP taking a prescribed medication without first consulting with your doctor.</span></p>

Encouraging an individual to participate in a religious congregation of their choice can assist with community reintegration.Developing an “Activity Preference Checklist” can assist with identifying and participating in activities of interest. If possible caring for a pet promotes social interactions.Many local “Independent Living Centers” offer educational and recreational opportunities. Many cities have community recreational centers. Call your local Mayor’s Committee for People with Disabilities or your nearest Brain Injury Support Group for other possible activities within your community.Check with friends, neighbors and co-workers to find out what activities or events they may know about which are free or have a nominal charge. If appropriate explore part-time volunteer opportunities. Doing anything that’s fun and challenging has rewards such as planting flowers, starting a small garden, star watching, coin collecting, fossil hunting, going for walks or picking up trash in the neighborhood once a week.If you elect to do nothing, you get nothing in return.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">9.  Transportation</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Just as people are different so will be their preferred choice of transport. Make a transportation plan that is safe and easy to follow. Good planning leads to good outcomes.Contact your local transportation authority for available specialized transportation resources. If one elects to drive following a sustained brain injury, securing a Driving Evaluation first is highly recommended.Many of the major rehabilitation hospitals offer this evaluation and frequently provide hands on training to assist in developing compensatory strategies for any lingering deficit.In addition, many of these programs can assist in obtaining the funding needed for any recommended vehicle modification necessary to improve one’s driving capabilities.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">10. Vocational Opportunities</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If you need assistance in securing meaningful employment and are at least 16 years old, then contact the Texas Workforce Commission for employment assistance.Also internet search engines can be used to expand one’s employment search opportunities. One may also consider starting with a volunteer job prior to seeking competitive employment, which can provide numerous therapeutic benefits. When locating employment it is best that an individual attempt to find a job that most closely matches your interest level with your skill level. In other words if you like the type of work you are doing and you have the skills needed to complete the assigned work, then you will likely do well at that job and be considered for advancement as the opportunity arises.</span></p>
