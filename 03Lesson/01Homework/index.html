      <h2>
        Welcome to the Howling Ranch!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here at The Howling Ranch we aim to provide a home for the many at-risk, and homeless wolf-hybrids in this country. <br>When I was 18-years old, I made the impulsive decision to buy a wolf-hybrid of my own, and immediately fell in love.<br> But for many wolf-hybrids that isn't the case. Unfortunately, most wolf-hybrids are abandoned by their owners<br>because the owner realizes that they are much higher maintenance than a typical dog, and it becomes too much for <br>them to handle. After being abandoned, wolf-hybrids are euthanized because they are thought of as dangerous. <br>The Howling Ranch is a safe haven for all wolves, hybrids, and otherwise abandoned dogs. This is their forever home!
