					<p class="container-text">Every day, I strive to stay challenged and inspired. Working in as a nurse has given me this gift and opportunity to stay driven. I have encountered such diverse and complex patients that makes every day a learning experience. I thrive off of working on a team and the ability to work together to reach one goal, which is to help the patient get better. I have cherished the experiences I have had and I hope to take my skills in order to be a confident family nurse practitioner. I am constantly looking into my future and trying to find new ways to become a competent nurse. Not only is becoming a family nurse practitioner one of my dreams, but working in a underprivileged family clinic and volunteering on a Mercy Ship is where I see myself in five years. I want to combine community service and my nursing career because I feel that my education should be used for a good cause.

From the moment I decided to be a registered nurse, I have been prepared to do research, find more opportunities, and gain professional responsibility. Right after receiving my bachelors in nursing, I wanted to be proactive. I needed to find a job and opportunities that would propel me towards a nurse practitioner program. I am lucky enough to have acquired a job where my schedule is flexible, so that I am able to do school, study and work. Ultimately, I would like to get back to school as soon as possible because I am determined to get back to studying and gaining my masters in a field that I can gain autonomy, opportunities and growth in my career.

From California to Texas, I took the challenge to embrace a new community where I knew nobody because I wanted to start working immediately. Within six months of graduating and doing home assisted living for Interim Healthcare and Home Care Assistance, I obtained a job at Central Texas Medical Center in San Marcos. I have discovered that I love my job as a nurse and the community that I have engulfed myself.

In my future, I see myself as a family nurse practitioner and using my education to influence many people. I believe that providing quality care is influenced by prevention and education, which I greatly want to encourage in the community. I have the passion and genuine love for nursing and helping others.
